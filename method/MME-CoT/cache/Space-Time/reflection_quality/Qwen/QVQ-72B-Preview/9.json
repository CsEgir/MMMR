            "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nWrite a description for the given image sequence in a single paragraph, what is happening in this episode?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nIn this comic sequence, a young boy is seen digging in his garden with a shovel. He accidentally stumbles upon an old, rusty metal object buried beneath the soil. As he lifts it out of the ground, a mysterious, glowing orb appears, emitting a bright light that illuminates the surrounding area. The boy's curiosity is piqued as he examines the orb, which seems to be floating above the ground. Suddenly, a small, purple bird-like creature emerges from the orb, startling the boy and causing him to drop the object. The bird then flies away, leaving the boy bewildered by what just happened.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
            "valid_outputs": "Alright, I've got this comic strip to describe. There are four panels, and I need to put them together into a coherent story. Let's take it panel by panel.\n\nStarting with the first panel: There's a young boy with curly hair, and he's outside near a brick wall. He's holding a shovel and seems to be digging in the grass. There's a purple bird nearby, and it looks like something has just happened, maybe he hit something with the shovel. The boy has a surprised expression on his face.\n\nMoving on to the second panel: Now, the boy is standing with the shovel resting on his shoulder. He's looking at a pile of dirt on the grass, and there are some bricks scattered around. It seems like he's taken a break from digging and is maybe contemplating what he's found or considering his next move.\n\nIn the third panel: There's a close-up of the boy's thought bubble. Inside the thought bubble, there are two purple birds, one of which is speaking, and there's a clock in the background. This suggests that the boy is thinking about something related to time or perhaps remembering something about these birds. The setting is still the same, with the brick wall and grass in the background.\n\nFinally, the fourth panel: The scene has changed slightly. The boy is no longer present. Instead, there are two purple birds standing near the pile of dirt. One of them is holding a shovel, and they both seem to be interacting with each other, possibly discussing what's happened or planning their next action.\n\nPutting it all together, it seems like the story revolves around the boy digging in his garden and encountering something unexpected, perhaps related to these purple birds. The thought bubble indicates that he's thinking about the birds and time, which might be significant to the plot.\n\nI need to make sure I include all the details: the boy digging, the purple bird appearing, the boy's reaction, the thought bubble with the birds and the clock, and finally the birds interacting near the dig site.\n\nAlso, I should pay attention to the background elements, like the brick wall and the grass, which remain consistent throughout the panels.\n\nLet me try to draft a description:\n\n\"In this four-panel comic strip, a young boy with curly hair is seen engaging in an adventurous digging expedition in his garden. The first panel introduces him surprise-digging near a brick wall, where he inadvertently uncovers a mysterious object, startling a nearby purple bird into flight. The second panel shows him pausing, shovel resting on his shoulder, as he contemplates the pile of dirt and scattered bricks before him. The third panel delves into his thoughts via a thought bubble, revealing two purple birds conversing near a clock, hinting at a possible connection to the earlier event. Finally, the fourth panel shifts focus to the two purple birds themselves, now standing near the dig site, one wielding a shovel, seemingly discussing their next move. Throughout the sequence, the consistent backdrop of the brick wall and grassy area ties the story together, building a sense of continuity and intrigue.\"\n\nI think that captures the main points. Now, I need to ensure that it's written in a single paragraph and that it flows smoothly.\n\nLet me read it again:\n\n\"In this four-panel comic strip, a young boy with curly hair is seen engaging in an adventurous digging expedition in his garden.
