            "valid_outputs": "Alright, I've got this problem here. It's about counting the number of unique objects in a scene based on four different views. Each view shows a certain number of cubes and maybe a cone, and I need to figure out how many distinct objects there are in total.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each view is showing. There are four separate images, each displaying a arrangement of cubes and possibly a cone. My task is to identify all unique objects across these views, making sure not to count any object more than once.\n\nLet me look at each view one by one.\n\n**First View:**\n\n- There are 5 cubes.\n\n- There is a small green cone.\n\nSo, in this view, I see five cubes and one small green cone.\n\n**Second View:**\n\n- There are 6 cubes.\n\n- There is a large blue cube.\n\nWait, in the second view, it says there are six cubes and a large blue cube. Is the large blue cube included in the six cubes, or is it an additional one? Hmm, maybe I need to clarify this.\n\nLooking back, the second view mentions \"there are 6 cubes\" and \"there is a large blue cube.\" It probably means that among the six cubes, one of them is a large blue cube. Alternatively, it might be an additional cube. But that seems unlikely because that would make it seven cubes in total for this view. I think the large blue cube is one of the six cubes mentioned.\n\n**Third View:**\n\n- There are 4 cubes.\n\n- There is a small green cone.\n\nSo, similar to the first view, but with fewer cubes.\n\n**Fourth View:**\n\n- There are 7 cubes.\n\n- There is a small green cone.\n\nThis view has seven cubes and a small green cone.\n\nNow, I need to identify unique objects. That means if an object appears in multiple views, I should count it only once.\n\nLooking at the cones:\n\n- A small green cone appears in the first, third, and fourth views.\n\n- In the second view, there's a large blue cube, but no mention of a cone.\n\nSo, the small green cone is present in three out of four views. Since it's the same cone, I should count it only once.\n\nAs for the cubes:\n\n- Each view has a certain number of cubes, but they are likely different arrangements or subsets of the total cubes.\n\nI need to determine how many distinct cubes there are in total across all views.\n\nThis seems like a problem of set union: combining all the cubes from each view and counting the unique ones.\n\nBut wait, it's possible that some cubes are visible in multiple views. For example, a cube might be visible in both the first and second views, meaning it's the same cube seen from different angles.\n\nHowever, without knowing which cubes are the same across views, it's challenging to determine the exact count of unique cubes.\n\nPerhaps I need to assume that unless specified otherwise, cubes are unique to each view.\n\nBut that doesn't seem right. There must be some overlap in the cubes across views.\n\nLet me think differently. Maybe I should consider that all views share some common objects, and I need to identify those overlaps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to simply add up the number of cubes and cones from all views, assuming no duplicates.\n\nBut that seems too straightforward, and it's likely that there are overlapping objects.\n\nWait a minute, in the first view, there are five cubes and one cone. In the second view, there are six cubes and one large blue cube (which might be one of the six). In the third view, four cubes and one cone. In the fourth view, seven cubes and one cone.\n\nIf I add up all the cubes: 5 + 6 + 4 + 7 = 22 cubes.\n\nBut that can't be right because some cubes are probably repeated across views.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the total number of unique cubes is the maximum number of cubes seen in any single view, which would be seven in the fourth view. But that also doesn't make sense because the arrangement in each view is different.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider that all views are showing different perspectives of the same setup, and I need to find a way to combine them.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem is about counting the total number of unique objects, where each object is only counted once, regardless of how many times it appears in different views.\n\nIn that case, if I have multiple views showing the same object, I should count it only once.\n\nGiven that, I need to identify all distinct objects across the four views.\n\nFrom the descriptions:\n\n- Small green cone appears in views 1, 3, and 4.\n\n- Large blue cube appears only in view 2.\n\n- Other cubes are present in various numbers in each view.\n\nAssuming that all cubes except the large blue cube are identical and indistinguishable across views, which might not be the case.\n\nBut in reality, cubes can differ in size, color, position, etc.\n\nHowever, in the descriptions, most cubes are just \"cubes,\" without specific identifiers.\n\nOnly in view 2, there's a \"large blue cube,\" which is distinct.\n\nIn view 1, there are five cubes and one small green cone.\n\nIn view 2, six cubes and one large blue cube.\n\nIn view 3, four cubes and one small green cone.\n\nIn view 4, seven cubes and one small green cone.\n\nIf I consider that the small green cone is the same in all views where it appears, then it should be counted only once.\n\nThe large blue cube is unique to view 2, so it's an additional object.\n\nThe other cubes in each view are likely distinct from each other, but I don't know if they are the same or different across views.\n\nThis is getting complicated. Maybe I need to approach this differently.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that each view shows a subset of the total objects, and I need to find the union of all objects across views.\n\nGiven that, I can list out all the objects seen in each view and then combine them, removing duplicates.\n\nBut to do that, I need to identify which objects are the same across views.\n\nThe small green cone is clearly the same across views 1, 3, and 4.\n\nThe large blue cube is only in view 2.\n\nThe other cubes: in view 1, there are five cubes; in view 2, six cubes (including the large blue cube); in view 3, four cubes; in view 4, seven cubes.\n\nAssuming that the cubes are distinct across views is probably not correct, as they might overlap.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the problem expects me to consider that all cubes are unique to each view, except for the small green cone, which is present in multiple views.\n\nIn that case, the total number of unique objects would be:\n\n- Small green cone: 1 (since it's the same across multiple views)\n\n- Cubes: 5 (from view 1) + 6 (from view 2) + 4 (from view 3) + 7 (from view 4) = 22, but that can't be right because some cubes must be the same.\n\nWait, no. If I assume that the small green cone is the same across views, then only one cone.\n\nSimilarly, the large blue cube is unique to view 2.\n\nThe other cubes: perhaps some are repeated across views.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the problem is about counting the total number of unique objects in the entire setup, not per view.\n\nIf that's the case, then I need to find the total number of distinct objects present in any of the views.\n\nGiven that, I can list all the objects from all views and remove duplicates.\n\nFrom the descriptions:\n\n- View 1: 5 cubes + 1 small green cone = 6 objects\n\n- View 2: 6 cubes + 1 large blue cube = 7 objects\n\n- View 3: 4 cubes + 1 small green cone = 5 objects\n\n- View 4: 7 cubes + 1 small green cone = 8 objects\n\nTotal objects without considering duplicates: 6 + 7 + 5 + 8 = 26 objects\n\nNow, identifying duplicates:\n\n- The small green cone appears in views 1, 3, and 4.\n\n- The large blue cube appears only in view 2.\n\nSo, the small green cone is repeated three times, but should only be counted once.\n\nTherefore, total unique objects: 26 - 2 (for the two extra small green cones) = 24 objects\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right. Let's think again.\n\nIf I have one small green cone that appears in three views, but it's the same cone, I should count it only once.\n\nSimilarly, the large blue cube is unique to view 2.\n\nNow, the other cubes: are they distinct or overlapping?\n\nWithout specific identifiers, it's hard to say.\n\nPerhaps I should consider that all cubes except the large blue cube are identical and indistinct.\n\nIn that case, the large blue cube is a distinct object.\n\nThe other cubes are indistinct, so they can be considered as a single type.\n\nTherefore, total unique objects:\n\n- Small green cone: 1\n\n- Large blue cube: 1\n\n- Other cubes: the total number of these cubes across all views.\n\nFrom view 1: 5 cubes (excluding the cone)\n\nFrom view 2: 6 cubes (excluding the large blue cube, so 5 indistinct cubes + 1 large blue cube)\n\nFrom view 3: 4 cubes (excluding the cone)\n\nFrom view 4: 7 cubes (excluding the cone)\n\nTotal indistinct cubes: 5 + 5 + 4 + 7 = 21 cubes\n\nAdding the small green cone and the large blue cube: 1 + 1 + 21 = 23 objects\n\nBut this seems too high. Maybe there's another way to look at it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps all cubes are distinct and should be counted separately.\n\nIn that case, the total number of unique objects would be:\n\n- Small green cone: 1\n\n- Large blue cube: 1\n\n- Other cubes: 5 (view 1) + 5 (view 2) + 4 (view 3) + 7 (view 4) = 21 cubes\n\nTotal: 1 + 1 + 21 = 23 objects\n\nBut this seems inconsistent with the solution provided earlier, which was 8 unique objects.\n\nWait, perhaps I misread the initial solution. Let's check again.\n\nLooking back at the problem:\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo determine the number of objects in the scene based on these views, we need to carefully analyze each view and ensure that no object is counted more than once.\n\n1. **First View:**\n\n- There are 5 cubes.\n\n- There is a small green cone.\n\n2. **Second View:**\n\n- There are 6 cubes.\n\n- There is a large blue cube.\n\n3. **Third View:**\n\n- There are 4 cubes.\n\n- There is a small green cone.\n\n4. **Fourth View:**\n\n- There are 7 cubes.\n\n- There is a small green cone.\n\nNow, let's count the unique objects:\n\n- The small green cone appears in all four views.\n\n- The cubes appear in different numbers in each view, but they are distinct objects.\n\nBy combining all the unique objects from each view, we get:\n\n- Small green cone (appears in all views)\n\n- Cubes (appear in different numbers in each view)\n\nThus, there are 8 unique objects in total.\n\n\\boxed{8}\n\nWait, but according to this, there are only 8 unique objects. But according to my earlier calculation, I got 23, which is way off.\n\nClearly, there's a mistake in my approach.\n\nLet me try to understand the solution's logic.\n\nIt says that the small green cone appears in all views, so it's only one unique cone.\n\nThen, the cubes appear in different",
