    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nHow many objects are there in the scene based on these views?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine the number of objects in the scene based on these views, we need to carefully analyze each view and ensure that no object is counted more than once.\n\n1. **First View**: There are 5 cubes.\n2. **Second View**: There are 6 cubes, including a purple pyramid.\n3. **Third View**: There are 7 cubes, including a purple sphere.\n4. **Fourth View**: There are 8 cubes, including a purple cube.\n\nBy examining all four views, we see that there are distinct objects in each view. However, some objects might be shared between views. To avoid double-counting, we should count each unique object only once.\n\n- From the first view: 5 cubes\n- From the second view: 6 cubes (including the purple pyramid)\n- From the third view: 7 cubes (including the purple sphere)\n- From the fourth view: 8 cubes (including the purple cube)\n\nSince the purple pyramid, purple sphere, and purple cube are distinct objects, we do not need to subtract any overlaps. Therefore, the total number of unique objects in the scene is:\n\n\\[\n5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 26\n\\]\n\nThus, the final answer is \\boxed{26}.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
