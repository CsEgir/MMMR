    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nThe first image is the original image, and the following images are the pieces of the original image. Put the pieces back together in the correct order. Your options are: A. [1, 0, 2, 3], B. [0, 1, 2, 3], C. [3, 0, 1, 2], D. [1, 3, 0, 2].\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the correct sequence of images that would reconstruct the original image. The key is to match the parts of the original image with their corresponding pieces.\n\nLet's analyze the given options:\n\nA. [1, 0, 2, 3]\nB. [0, 1, 2, 3]\nC. [3, 0, 1, 2]\nD. [1, 3, 0, 2]\n\nWe need to determine which order will correctly piece together the original image. \n\nOption A: [1, 0, 2, 3] suggests starting with part 1, then part 0, followed by part 2, and ending with part 3.\nOption B: [0, 1, 2, 3] suggests starting with part 0, then part 1, followed by part 2, and ending with part 3.\nOption C: [3, 0, 1, 2] suggests starting with part 3, then part 0, followed by part 1, and ending with part 2.\nOption D: [1, 3, 0, 2] suggests starting with part 1, then part 3, followed by part 0, and ending with part 2.\n\nGiven the description, it seems logical that the original image might be reconstructed in a way where the top part (part 1) is connected first, followed by the middle part (part 0), then the bottom part (part 2), and finally the side part (part 3).\n\nTherefore, the correct order should be:\n\\[ \\text{[1, 0, 2, 3]} \\]\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{A}.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
    "valid_outputs": "```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"The reflection step identified is 'But xxx' which suggests a reconsideration of the previous statement.\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A\"\n  }\n]\n```",
