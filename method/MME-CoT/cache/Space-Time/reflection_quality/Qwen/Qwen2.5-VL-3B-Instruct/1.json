    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nWrite a description for the given image sequence in a single paragraph, what is happening in this episode?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nIn this sequence of images, a playful scene unfolds on a grassy field where two dogs are engaged in a lively interaction. The first image shows one dog playfully jumping towards the other, initiating a chase or game. In the second image, both dogs are seen mid-air, with their bodies stretched out as they attempt to catch each other. The third image captures them in a dynamic pose, suggesting a moment of physical contact or a playful tussle. The fourth image depicts one dog leaping over the other, emphasizing the energetic nature of their interaction. In the fifth image, the dogs continue their playful antics, with one dog appearing to be slightly ahead and the other following closely behind. The sixth image shows a close-up of the dogs' faces, highlighting their expressions of joy and excitement. Finally, in the seventh image, the dogs have separated, with one dog running away from the other, indicating that the playful chase has concluded. Throughout the sequence, the dogs exhibit enthusiasm and energy, creating a heartwarming display of canine camaraderie.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
