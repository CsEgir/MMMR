    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nHow many objects are there in the scene based on these views?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine the number of objects in the scene based on these views, we need to carefully analyze each view and ensure that no object is counted more than once.\n\n1. **First View:**\n   - There are 6 purple cylinders.\n   - There is 1 yellow cylinder.\n\n2. **Second View:**\n   - There are 5 purple cylinders.\n   - There is 1 yellow cylinder.\n\n3. **Third View:**\n   - There are 4 purple cylinders.\n   - There is 1 yellow cylinder.\n\n4. **Fourth View:**\n   - There are 7 purple cylinders.\n   - There is 1 yellow cylinder.\n\nNow, let's count the total number of objects by combining all the counts from each view:\n\n- Purple cylinders:\n  - First view: 6\n  - Second view: 5\n  - Third view: 4\n  - Fourth view: 7\n\n  Total purple cylinders = 6 + 5 + 4 + 7 = 22\n\n- Yellow cylinders:\n  - All views show only 1 yellow cylinder.\n\nTotal objects = Number of purple cylinders + Number of yellow cylinders\n              = 22 + 1\n              = 23\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{23}.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
