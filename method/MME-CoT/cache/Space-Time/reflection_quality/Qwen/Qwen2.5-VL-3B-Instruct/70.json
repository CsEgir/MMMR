    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\n<image> <image> <image> <image> <image>Please predict the last 10 frames of the video based on the first 10 frames of the input video. Note that the order is from left to right.The last four images represent four choices, referred to as Candidate 1, Candidate 2, Candidate 3, Candidate 4, respectively.\nA. Candidate 1: last 10 frames\nB. Candidate 2: last 10 frames\nC. Candidate 3: last 10 frames\nD. Candidate 4: last 10 frames\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo predict the last 10 frames of the video based on the first 10 frames provided, I would need to analyze the patterns and transitions observed in those initial frames. However, since you've only shared four candidate images (Candidate 1, Candidate 2, Candidate 3, Candidate 4), I can't make a definitive prediction without seeing all ten frames.\n\nIf you could provide the complete set of ten frames, I'd be able to analyze them more thoroughly and offer a more accurate prediction for the next ten frames. Without that information, I can't determine which of the given candidates is most likely to continue the sequence correctly.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
