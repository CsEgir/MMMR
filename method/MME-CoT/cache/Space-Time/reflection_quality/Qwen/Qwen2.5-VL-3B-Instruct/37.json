    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nHow many objects are there in the scene based on these views?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine the number of objects in the scene based on these views, we need to carefully analyze each view and ensure that no object is counted more than once.\n\n1. **First View:**\n   - There are 6 cylinders.\n   - One of them is a cone.\n\n2. **Second View:**\n   - There are 7 cylinders.\n   - One of them is a cone.\n\n3. **Third View:**\n   - There are 5 cylinders.\n   - One of them is a cone.\n\n4. **Fourth View:**\n   - There are 8 cylinders.\n   - One of them is a cone.\n\nNow, let's combine all the views while ensuring we do not double-count any objects:\n\n- From the first view, we have 6 cylinders (including the cone).\n- From the second view, we add 7 cylinders (including the cone), but one of these is already counted from the first view.\n- From the third view, we add 5 cylinders (including the cone), but one of these is already counted from the first view.\n- From the fourth view, we add 8 cylinders (including the cone), but one of these is already counted from the first view.\n\nAfter combining all views, we count the unique objects:\n- The cone is counted once.\n- The remaining objects are the cylinders, which total \\(6 + 7 + 5 + 8 = 26\\) cylinders.\n\nThus, the total number of objects in the scene is \\(\\boxed{26}\\).\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
