    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nHow many objects are there in the scene based on these views?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine the number of objects in the scene based on these views, let's analyze each view separately and then combine the information.\n\n**View 1:**\n- There is a green cube.\n- On top of this green cube, there is a purple pyramid.\n- Next to the purple pyramid, there is a brown cylinder.\n- Below the brown cylinder, there is another green cube.\n\nSo, from View 1, we have:\n1. Green cube\n2. Purple pyramid\n3. Brown cylinder\n4. Another green cube\n\n**View 2:**\n- There is a large green cube.\n- On top of this large green cube, there is a smaller green cube.\n- To the right of the large green cube, there is a brown cylinder.\n- Below the brown cylinder, there is a small black sphere.\n- In front of the brown cylinder, there is another green cube.\n\nSo, from View 2, we have:\n1. Large green cube\n2. Smaller green cube\n3. Brown cylinder\n4. Small black sphere\n5. Another green cube\n\nNow, let's combine the information from both views:\n- From View 1, we have 4 distinct objects.\n- From View 2, we add 5 more distinct objects (large green cube, smaller green cube, brown cylinder, small black sphere, and another green cube).\n\nTherefore, the total number of distinct objects in the scene is \\(4 + 5 = 9\\).\n\n\\boxed{9}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
    "valid_outputs": "```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"The solution incorrectly counts the objects as if they are distinct from each other, but in reality, some objects overlap or share positions.\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"Wrong Conclusion\"\n  }\n]\n```",
