    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nWrite a description for the given image sequence in a single paragraph, what is happening in this episode?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nIn this sequence of images, two children are engaged in playful activities on a floral-patterned couch. Initially, one child is sitting and the other is lying down, both interacting with a blue book. The scene transitions to show the child who was initially lying down now standing up, continuing to play with the book while the other child remains seated. In subsequent frames, the child who was standing up is seen bending over, possibly to pick something up or adjust their position. Meanwhile, the child who was initially lying down is now sitting upright, still focused on the book. The final frames depict the children resting on separate beds, suggesting a shift from active play to a more relaxed state.\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nThe sequence of images captures moments in a living room where two children and a baby are engaged in various activities. The child dressed in red is playfully rolling around on the sofa, seemingly enjoying the fun of tumbling about. Meanwhile, the boy wearing a striped outfit is intently flipping through the pages of a book, leaning on the sofa as he looks at its contents. After an attempt at a headstand, the girl in red lies back down on the sofa to rest. In the final scenes, a baby dressed in blue is seen moving their hands in a stretching motion while lying in a crib, their head comfortably elevated on a pillow. The overall atmosphere is one of casual, playful relaxation within the family's living space.",
