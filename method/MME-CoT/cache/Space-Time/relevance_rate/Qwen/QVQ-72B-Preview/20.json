            "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, evaluate the relevance to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) of each step.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Relevancy\nA relevant step is considered as: 75% content of the step must be related to trying to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) to the question. \n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: \nEvaluate relevancy independent of correctness. As long as the step is trying to get to a solution, it is considered relevant. Logical fallacy, knowledge mistake, inconsistent with previous steps, or other mistakes do not affect relevance.\nA logically wrong step can be relevant if the reasoning attempts to address the question.\n\nThe following behaviour is considered as relevant:\ni. The step is planning, summarizing, thinking, verifying, calculating, or confirming an intermediate/final conclusion helpful to get a solution.\nii. The step is summarizing or reflecting on previously reached conclusion relevant to get a solution.\niii. Repeating the information in the question or give the final answer.\niv. A relevant image depiction shoule be in one of following situation: 1. help to obtain a conclusion helpful to solve the question later; 2. help to identify certain patterns in the image later; 3. directly contributes to the answer\nv. Depicting or analyzing the options of the question is also relevant.\nvi. Repeating previous relevant steps are also considered relevant. \n\nThe following behaviour is considered as irrelevant: \ni. Depicting image information that does not related to what is asking in the question.  Example: The question asks how many cars are present in all the images. If the step focuses on other visual elements like the road or building, the step is considered as irrelevant.\nii. Self-thought not related to what the question is asking.\niii. Other information that is tangential for answering the question.\n\n\n# Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"A brief summary of step result\",\n    \"relevant\": \"Yes|No\"\n  }\n]\n\n\n# Output Rules\nDirect JSON output without any other output\nOutput at most 40 steps\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nWrite a description for the given image sequence in a single paragraph, what is happening in this episode?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nIn this sequence of images, a robotic arm is interacting with various objects on a flat surface. Initially, the arm places a blue triangular object onto a blue plate. It then picks up another blue triangular object and places it back onto the same plate. Following this, the arm moves to pick up a red spherical object and places it next to the blue triangular object on the plate. The arm then lifts the blue triangular object again and places it back onto the plate. Finally, the arm removes the blue triangular object from the plate and sets it aside. Throughout the sequence, the other objects remain stationary on the table.",
            "valid_outputs": "Alright, I've got this sequence of images showing a robotic arm interacting with different objects on a flat surface. There are seven images in total, numbered from 1 to 7. My task is to describe what's happening in this episode by looking at these images step by step.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the setup. There are various objects on the table, including blue triangular shapes, a blue plate, a red spherical object, and some other items like a jar and some small figures. The robotic arm is manipulating these objects in a specific sequence.\n\nLet me look at each image one by one to see the actions being performed.\n\nStarting with image 1:\n\n- The robotic arm is positioned above the table, reaching towards a blue triangular object.\n\n- There is a blue plate on the table with some objects around it.\n\n- Other objects like a jar, some small red and gray spheres, and wooden-like figures are also present.\n\nIn image 2:\n\n- The robotic arm has picked up the blue triangular object and is placing it onto the blue plate.\n\n- The rest of the objects remain stationary.\n\nImage 3:\n\n- The arm is now picking up another blue triangular object from the table.\n\n- Again, the other objects haven't moved.\n\nImage 4:\n\n- The arm places the second blue triangular object back onto the blue plate.\n\n- A red spherical object is still on the table, untouched at this point.\n\nImage 5:\n\n- The arm picks up the red spherical object and places it next to the blue triangular objects on the plate.\n\n- The other objects remain in place.\n\nImage 6:\n\n- The arm lifts one of the blue triangular objects again and places it back onto the plate.\n\n- The red object and other items stay where they are.\n\nFinally, image 7:\n\n- The arm removes one of the blue triangular objects from the plate and sets it aside on the table.\n\n- The remaining objects on the plate are the other blue triangular object and the red spherical object.\n\nFrom observing these images, it seems like the robotic arm is performing a series of pick-and-place operations, specifically focusing on the blue triangular objects and the red spherical object onto the blue plate.\n\nTo summarize the sequence:\n\n1. The arm picks up the first blue triangular object and places it on the blue plate.\n\n2. It then picks up the second blue triangular object and places it on the same plate.\n\n3. Next, it picks up the red spherical object and places it alongside the blue triangular objects on the plate.\n\n4. It then lifts one of the blue triangular objects and places it back on the plate.\n\n5. Finally, it removes one of the blue triangular objects from the plate and places it elsewhere on the table.\n\nThroughout this sequence, the other objects on the table remain stationary, indicating that the arm is only interacting with these specific objects.\n\nNow, to put this into a descriptive paragraph as required:\n\n\"In this sequence of images, a robotic arm is interacting with various objects on a flat surface. Initially, the arm places a blue triangular object onto a blue plate. It then picks up another blue triangular object and places it back onto the same plate. Following this, the arm moves to pick up a red spherical object and places it next to the blue triangular object on the plate. The arm then lifts the blue triangular object again and places it back onto the plate. Finally, the arm removes the blue triangular object from the plate and sets it aside. Throughout the sequence, the other objects remain stationary on the table.\"\n\nThis should adequately describe the actions taking place in the image sequence. I think that's a clear and concise summary of what's happening.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{In this sequence of images, a robotic arm is interacting with various objects on a flat surface.
