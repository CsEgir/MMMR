Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Relevancy\nA relevant step is considered as: 75% content of the step must be related to trying to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) to the question. \n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: \nEvaluate relevancy independent of correctness. As long as the step is trying to get to a solution, it is considered relevant. Logical fallacy, knowledge mistake, inconsistent with previous steps, or other mistakes do not affect relevance.\nA logically wrong step can be relevant if the reasoning attempts to address the question.\n\nThe following behaviour is considered as relevant:\ni. The step is planning, summarizing, thinking, verifying, calculating, or confirming an intermediate/final conclusion helpful to get a solution.\nii. The step is summarizing or reflecting on previously reached conclusion relevant to get a solution.\niii. Repeating the information in the question or give the final answer.\niv. A relevant image depiction shoule be in one of following situation: 1. help to obtain a conclusion helpful to solve the question later; 2. help to identify certain patterns in the image later; 3. directly contributes to the answer\nv. Depicting or analyzing the options of the question is also relevant.\nvi. Repeating previous relevant steps are also considered relevant. \n\nThe following behaviour is considered as irrelevant: \ni. Depicting image information that does not related to what is asking in the question.  Example: The question asks how many cars are present in all the images. If the step focuses on other visual elements like the road or building, the step is considered as irrelevant.\nii. Self-thought not related to what the question is asking.\niii. Other information that is tangential for answering the question.\n\n\n# Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"A brief summary of step result\",\n    \"relevant\": \"Yes|No\"\n  }\n]\n\n\n# Output Rules\nDirect JSON output without any other output\nOutput at most 40 steps\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\n<image> <image> <image> <image> <image> <image> what is the number that appears on the blue column on the building in the given images?\nA. twenty\nB. fifteen\nC. five\nD.

            "valid_outputs": "Alright, I've got this task to evaluate a solution for an image-based problem. The problem involves six different images, and the question is about a number that appears on a blue column on a building in those images. The options are twenty, fifteen, five, or none of the choices provided.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the question is asking. It seems like there are six images provided, and in one of them, there's a blue column on a building with a number on it. I need to identify which number is on that column.\n\nLooking at the solution provided, it's just a single line saying \"None of the choices provided.\" That suggests that the number on the blue column isn't any of the given options: twenty, fifteen, or five.\n\nBut to properly evaluate this, I need to look at each image and see what's there.\n\nLet's go through each image one by one.\n\nStarting with the first image:\n\nIt shows a large ship docked near a building. There are several cars parked in a lot in front of the ship. The sky is overcast, and there are some cranes visible in the background. I don't see any building with a blue column in this image.\n\nMoving on to the second image:\n\nThis is a street view with a multi-story building on the right side. The building has large windows and appears to be industrial or commercial. There's a sign with the number \"23\" on it. The street is empty, and there are cars parked along the curb. Again, no blue column on a building is visible here.\n\nNext, the third image:\n\nThis is a closer view of the same building from the second image. The building has a blue awning with the number \"23\" and some text below it. Several cars are parked in front of the building, and there are people walking around. Still, no blue column is visible.\n\nNow, the fourth image:\n\nThis image shows a construction site with a large crane and a building under construction in the background. There are several cars parked in a lot fenced with a chain-link fence. The sky is overcast, and there are trees in the background. No blue column here either.\n\nThe fifth image:\n\nThis is another street view with a multi-story brick building on the right side. There's a white truck parked on the side of the road, and several cars are parked along the curb. The street appears to be empty. Again, no blue column is visible.\n\nFinally, the sixth image:\n\nThis is a close-up of a white delivery truck parked on the side of the road. The truck has text on its side, including \"LA FRIEDA VEAL & LAMB CO. INC.\" and an address in North Bergen, NJ. The building in the background has large windows and seems industrial. No blue column is visible here either.\n\nAfter reviewing all six images, I don't see any blue column on a building with a number on it. The only numbers I can see are on signs or on vehicles, but none on a blue column on a building.\n\nTherefore, based on the images provided, the number on the blue column on the building isn't any of the given options: twenty, fifteen, or five. So, the solution \"None of the choices provided\" seems appropriate.\n\nHowever, to be thorough, I should check if there's any possibility that a blue column with a number is present in any of the images but wasn't noticed.\n\nLet me double-check each image:\n\nFirst image: Ship and cars\u2014no blue column.\n\nSecond image: Building with \"23\" sign\u2014no blue column.\n\nThird image: Closer view of building with \"23\" sign\u2014still no blue column.\n\nFourth image: Construction site\u2014no blue column.\n\nFifth image: Brick building and street\u2014no blue column.\n\nSixth image: Delivery truck and building\u2014no blue column.\n\nI can't find any blue column with a number on a building in any of these images. Therefore, the solution is correctly identified as \"None of the choices provided.\"\n\nBut wait, maybe the blue column is not clearly visible or is partially obscured in the images. However, based on what's visible, there isn't any such column with a number on it.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the blue column is in one of the images, but it's not clearly visible due to the angle or distance. But again, from what's shown, it's not present.\n\nIn conclusion, after carefully reviewing all six images, I agree with the solution that none of the provided choices (twenty, fifteen, five) appear on a blue column on a building in the given images. Therefore, the answer is \"None of the choices provided.\"\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{D. None of the choices provided}} \\]",
