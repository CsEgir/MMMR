Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Relevancy\nA relevant step is considered as: 75% content of the step must be related to trying to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) to the question. \n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: \nEvaluate relevancy independent of correctness. As long as the step is trying to get to a solution, it is considered relevant. Logical fallacy, knowledge mistake, inconsistent with previous steps, or other mistakes do not affect relevance.\nA logically wrong step can be relevant if the reasoning attempts to address the question.\n\nThe following behaviour is considered as relevant:\ni. The step is planning, summarizing, thinking, verifying, calculating, or confirming an intermediate/final conclusion helpful to get a solution.\nii. The step is summarizing or reflecting on previously reached conclusion relevant to get a solution.\niii. Repeating the information in the question or give the final answer.\niv. A relevant image depiction shoule be in one of following situation: 1. help to obtain a conclusion helpful to solve the question later; 2. help to identify certain patterns in the image later; 3. directly contributes to the answer\nv. Depicting or analyzing the options of the question is also relevant.\nvi. Repeating previous relevant steps are also considered relevant. \n\nThe following behaviour is considered as irrelevant: \ni. Depicting image information that does not related to what is asking in the question.  Example: The question asks how many cars are present in all the images. If the step focuses on other visual elements like the road or building, the step is considered as irrelevant.\nii. Self-thought not related to what the question is asking.\niii. Other information that is tangential for answering the question.\n\n\n# Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"A brief summary of step result\",\n    \"relevant\": \"Yes|No\"\n  }\n]\n\n\n# Output Rules\nDirect JSON output without any other output\nOutput at most 40 steps\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\n<image> <image> <image> <image> <image> <image> what does the rectangular, yellow sign say in the given images?\nA. caution\nB. danger\nC.

            "valid_outputs": "Alright, I've got this task to evaluate a solution for an image-based problem. The problem shows six images and asks about a rectangular, yellow sign that says \"Cyclists Ahead Slow.\" I need to reformat the solution into distinct reasoning steps and then evaluate each step's relevance to getting a solution, regardless of whether it's correct or not.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what the task is asking. There are six images provided, and among them, there's a sign that says \"Cyclists Ahead Slow.\" The question is asking what this sign says, and there are multiple-choice options: A. caution, B. danger, C. none of the choices provided, D. warning.\n\nMy goal is to reformat the solution into steps, each of which is either a logical inference, an image description, or background information. Then, I need to evaluate whether each step is relevant to trying to get a solution to the question.\n\nLet me start by looking at the images one by one.\n\nImage 1: It shows a street scene with a building on the left, a road, and some pedestrians. There's a signpost with a yellow rectangular sign that says \"Cyclists Ahead Slow.\" Two people are standing near the building entrance.\n\nImage 2: This image seems to be a different angle of a building, possibly the same area as image 1, but it's not clear if the sign is visible here.\n\nImage 3: Another street view, showing buildings, trees, and a road. No sign is prominently visible.\n\nImage 4: A close-up of a building's wall with a small sign indicating CCTV surveillance. Not relevant to the sign in question.\n\nImage 5: A wider street view with multiple buildings, trees, and a few people walking. Again, no clear sign visible.\n\nImage 6: A building entrance with bicycles parked outside. No sign is visible in this image.\n\nFrom these observations, only image 1 clearly shows the sign in question. The other images might be from the same location but don't show the sign.\n\nNow, let's think about how to reformat the solution into steps.\n\nStep 1: Identify the sign in image 1.\n\nConclusion: The sign is yellow and rectangular, with the text \"Cyclists Ahead Slow.\"\n\nRelevant: Yes, because it directly answers the question.\n\nStep 2: Compare this sign with the given options.\n\nOptions are:\n\nA. caution\n\nB. danger\n\nC. none of the choices provided\n\nD. warning\n\nRelevant: Yes, because it's necessary to see which option matches the sign's message.\n\nStep 3: Determine which option best describes the sign.\n\n\"Cyclists Ahead Slow\" is a warning to slow down because there are cyclists ahead.\n\nRelevant: Yes, because it involves interpreting the sign's meaning.\n\nStep 4: Match the sign's meaning to the closest option.\n\n\"Cyclists Ahead Slow\" is a warning sign, as it warns drivers to slow down due to cyclists ahead.\n\nRelevant: Yes, because it's part of the reasoning process to select the correct answer.\n\nStep 5: Select the option that best matches \"warning.\"\n\nOption D is \"warning.\"\n\nRelevant: Yes, because it's the final step in choosing the answer.\n\nNow, considering the relevance criteria, all these steps are relevant because they directly contribute to finding and interpreting the sign's message and matching it to the given options.\n\nHowever, looking back at the solution provided, it seems that the answer given is \"Cyclists Ahead Slow,\" which doesn't match any of the provided options directly. But according to my reasoning, it should be matched to option D: warning.\n\nPerhaps there was a misunderstanding in the solution provided, as it directly states the sign's text without relating it to the options.\n\nIn that case, the solution might have only described the sign without attempting to match it to the given choices.\n\nBut the task is to evaluate the solution steps, not the correctness of the answer.\n\nSo, if the solution only describes the sign and doesn't attempt to choose an option, then the steps would be:\n\nStep 1: Describe the sign in image 1.\n\nConclusion: The sign is yellow and rectangular, with the text \"Cyclists Ahead Slow.\"\n\nRelevant: Yes, because it's directly addressing the question.\n\nStep 2: State that this sign does not exactly match any of the provided options.\n\nRelevant: Yes, because it's part of the reasoning process.\n\nStep 3: Decide to select \"none of the choices provided.\"\n\nRelevant: Yes, because it's a conclusion based on the observation that the exact sign text isn't listed in the options.\n\nAlternatively, if the solver realized that \"warning\" is the closest option, they might have chosen D.\n\nBut based on the solution provided, it seems they went with \"none of the choices provided.\"\n\nRegardless, both paths are relevant to trying to get a solution.\n\nIn summary, all steps in the solution are relevant because they are directly related to identifying and interpreting the sign in the images and matching it to the given options.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{Yes, all steps are relevant.}} \\]",
