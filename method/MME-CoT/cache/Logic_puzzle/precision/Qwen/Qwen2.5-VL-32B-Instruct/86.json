Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nWhich figure is a rotation of the object?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo determine which figure is a rotation of the given object, we need to analyze the positions of the symbols (+, ×, and the circles) relative to each other and the grid lines. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n### Original Object:\n- The black circle is in the top-left quadrant.\n- The white circle is in the bottom-right quadrant.\n- The \"+\" symbol is in the top-right quadrant.\n- The \"×\" symbol is in the bottom-left quadrant.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Relative Positions**: The symbols are arranged symmetrically around the center of the grid.\n2. **Rotation**: A rotation will preserve the relative distances and orientations of the symbols but will change their absolute positions on the grid.\n\n### Analyzing Each Option:\n#### Option A:\n- Black circle: Top-left\n- White circle: Bottom-right\n- \"+\": Top-right\n- \"×\": Bottom-left\n\nThis matches the original object exactly. However, since the question asks for a **rotation**, this option is not a rotated version but rather an identical copy.\n\n#### Option B:\n- Black circle: Top-left\n- White circle: Bottom-right\n- \"+\": Bottom-left\n- \"×\": Top-right\n\nHere, the \"+\" and \"×\" symbols have swapped positions compared to the original. This is not a valid rotation because rotations preserve the relative positions of all elements.\n\n#### Option C:\n- Black circle: Bottom-right\n- White circle: Top-left\n- \"+\": Bottom-left\n- \"×\": Top-right\n\nThis configuration shows a 180-degree rotation of the original object:\n- The black circle moves from top-left to bottom-right.\n- The white circle moves from bottom-right to top-left.\n- The \"+\" moves from top-right to bottom-left.\n- The \"×\" moves from bottom-left to top-right.\n\nAll elements maintain their relative positions but are flipped across both axes, which is consistent with a 180-degree rotation.\n\n#### Option D:\n- Black circle: Bottom-right\n- White circle: Top-left\n- \"+\": Top-right\n- \"×\": Bottom-left\n\nThis configuration does not match any valid rotation of the original object. The symbols are not in positions that would result from a rotation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only option that represents a valid rotation of the original object is **Option C**, which shows a 180-degree rotation.\n\n\\boxed{C}\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nC",
