    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\n<image>The image displays an intelligence test question in the form of a matrix pattern puzzle. There are eight shapes provided, with one space left blank, indicated by a question mark. The shapes are organized into three rows, each containing three boxes. Your task is to select the correct shape from six options (labeled A to F) to fill the empty box, completing the pattern that links all the shapes together.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this matrix pattern puzzle, we need to identify the underlying rules governing the arrangement of shapes in the rows and columns. Let's analyze the given matrix step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Rows\n#### Row 1:\n- The shapes are:\n  - A dashed circle (`○`)\n  - A solid blue square (`□`)\n  - A solid blue triangle (`△`)\n\n#### Row 2:\n- The shapes are:\n  - A solid blue triangle (`▲`)\n  - A solid blue circle (`●`)\n  - A dashed blue square (`□`)\n\n#### Row 3:\n- The shapes are:\n  - A solid blue square (`□`)\n  - A dashed blue triangle (`△`)\n  - A question mark (`?`)\n\n### Step 2: Identify Patterns\nWe need to look for consistent patterns in both rows and columns.\n\n#### Pattern in Rows:\n1. **Shape Type**: Each row contains one circle, one square, and one triangle.\n2. **Line Style**: Each row alternates between solid and dashed lines for the shapes.\n   - Row 1: Dashed circle, solid square, solid triangle.\n   - Row 2: Solid triangle, solid circle, dashed square.\n   - Row 3: Solid square, dashed triangle, ? (missing shape).\n\n#### Pattern in Columns:\n1. **Shape Type**: Each column should contain one circle, one square, and one triangle.\n   - Column 1: Circle (`○`), Triangle (`▲`), Square (`□`).\n   - Column 2: Square (`□`), Circle (`●`), Triangle (`△`).\n   - Column 3: Triangle (`△`), Square (`□`), ? (missing shape).\n\n2. **Line Style**: Each column alternates between solid and dashed lines for the shapes.\n   - Column 1: Dashed circle, solid triangle, solid square.\n   - Column 2: Solid square, solid circle, dashed triangle.\n   - Column 3: Solid triangle, dashed square, ? (missing shape).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Missing Shape\nFrom the analysis:\n- In **Column 3**, the shapes are:\n  - Solid triangle (`△`)\n  - Dashed square (`□`)\n  - ? (missing shape)\n- The missing shape must be a **circle** to complete the set of circle, square, and triangle in each column.\n- The line style alternates: solid, dashed, solid. Therefore, the missing shape should be a **solid circle**.\n\n### Step 4: Match the Answer\nThe options provided are:\n- **A**: Dashed square (`□`)\n- **B**: Solid circle (`●`)\n- **C**: Dashed triangle (`△`)\n- **D**: Solid circle (`●`)\n- **E**: Dashed circle (`○`)\n- **F**: Solid triangle (`▲`)\n\nThe correct shape is a **solid circle** (`●`), which matches options **B** and **D**. Since both are correct based on the pattern, we can choose either. Conventionally, we select the first correct option listed.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{B}\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nB",
