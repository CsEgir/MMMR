    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nWhich of the boxes comes next in the sequence? Select answers from A-E\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo determine which box comes next in the sequence, let's analyze the pattern step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the sequence\nThe sequence provided is:\n1. A box with a semicircle and a square.\n2. A box with a crescent shape and a square.\n3. A box with a semicircle and a smaller semicircle.\n4. A box with a square and a semicircle.\n5. A box with a crescent shape and a semicircle.\n\n### Step 2: Look for patterns\n#### Pattern 1: Shapes\n- The shapes alternate between **semicircles** and **crescents**.\n  - Semicircle → Crescent → Semicircle → Crescent → Semicircle → ...\n  \n#### Pattern 2: Position of shapes\n- The position of the shapes seems to shift systematically:\n  - In the first box, the semicircle is on the left, and the square is on the right.\n  - In the second box, the crescent is on the left, and the square is on the right.\n  - In the third box, the semicircle is on the left, and the smaller semicircle is on the right.\n  - In the fourth box, the square is on the left, and the semicircle is on the right.\n  - In the fifth box, the crescent is on the left, and the semicircle is on the right.\n\n#### Pattern 3: Additional elements\n- There is a consistent presence of a **square** or a **semicircle** in each box, alternating their positions relative to the main shape.\n\n### Step 3: Predict the next box\n- The last box (fifth box) has a crescent on the left and a semicircle on the right.\n- Following the alternating pattern of shapes:\n  - After a crescent, the next shape should be a **semicircle**.\n- Following the alternating pattern of positions:\n  - After a crescent on the left and a semicircle on the right, the next box should have the semicircle on the left and another shape on the right.\n\n### Step 4: Match the options\nNow, let's match the predicted pattern with the given options (A-E):\n- **Option A**: Semicircle on the left and a square on the right.\n- **Option B**: Square on the left and a crescent on the right.\n- **Option C**: Semicircle on the left and a larger semicircle on the right.\n- **Option D**: Square on the left and a crescent on the right.\n- **Option E**: Crescent on the left and squares on the right.\n\nFrom the analysis:\n- The next shape should be a **semicircle**.\n- The semicircle should be on the **left**.\n- The shape on the right should be a **square** (as it alternates with the semicircle).\n\nThus, the correct option is **A**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{A}\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nA",
