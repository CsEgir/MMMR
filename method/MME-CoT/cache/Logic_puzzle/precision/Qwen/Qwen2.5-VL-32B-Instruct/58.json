    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nWhich figure is a rotation of the object?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo determine which figure is a rotation of the given object, let's analyze the structure and orientation of the object step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Original Object\nThe original object is a 3D shape composed of cubes. Key observations:\n- The shape has a vertical column of cubes on the left.\n- There is an additional cube extending horizontally from the second cube in the vertical column.\n- The overall structure resembles an \"L\" shape when viewed from the front.\n\n### Step 2: Examine Each Option\nWe will compare each option (A, B, C, D) to the original object to see if it can be obtained by rotating the original shape.\n\n#### Option A:\n- The shape has a vertical column of cubes on the left.\n- There is an additional cube extending horizontally from the second cube in the vertical column.\n- This matches the original object exactly.\n- **This could be a rotation of the original object.**\n\n#### Option B:\n- The shape has a vertical column of cubes on the left.\n- There is an additional cube extending horizontally from the top cube in the vertical column.\n- This does not match the original object because the horizontal extension is in a different position.\n- **This is not a rotation of the original object.**\n\n#### Option C:\n- The shape has a vertical column of cubes on the right.\n- There is an additional cube extending horizontally from the second cube in the vertical column.\n- This is a mirror image of the original object, not a rotation.\n- **This is not a rotation of the original object.**\n\n#### Option D:\n- The shape has a vertical column of cubes on the right.\n- There is an additional cube extending horizontally from the top cube in the vertical column.\n- This does not match the original object because the horizontal extension is in a different position and the orientation is incorrect.\n- **This is not a rotation of the original object.**\n\n### Step 3: Confirm the Correct Answer\nFrom the analysis, only Option A matches the original object when rotated. The other options either have the horizontal extension in the wrong position or are mirror images.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{A}\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nC",
