    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nWhich figure is a rotation of the object? Select from A, B, C, and D. (A) (B) (C) (D)\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo determine which figure is a rotation of the given object, let's analyze the original shape and compare it to the options provided.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Original Shape\nThe original shape is a 3D object that resembles the letter \"T\" with an additional cube attached to the top-left corner of the vertical bar. Key features:\n- The main structure is a \"T\" shape.\n- There is a black cube attached to the top-left corner of the vertical bar.\n\n### Step 2: Compare with Each Option\nWe will rotate the original shape mentally or visualize its possible orientations to match one of the given options.\n\n#### Option A:\n- The shape in Option A has a similar \"L\" configuration but is oriented differently.\n- The black cube is positioned on the bottom-left side of the vertical bar.\n- This does not match the original shape when rotated.\n\n#### Option B:\n- The shape in Option B has a similar \"L\" configuration.\n- The black cube is positioned on the top-right side of the vertical bar.\n- This matches the original shape if we rotate the original object 90 degrees clockwise around the vertical axis.\n\n#### Option C:\n- The shape in Option C has a different orientation.\n- The black cube is positioned on the bottom-right side of the vertical bar.\n- This does not match the original shape when rotated.\n\n#### Option D:\n- The shape in Option D has a similar \"L\" configuration.\n- The black cube is positioned on the top-left side of the horizontal bar.\n- This does not match the original shape when rotated.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\nAfter analyzing all the options, Option B is the only one that can be obtained by rotating the original shape. Specifically, rotating the original shape 90 degrees clockwise around the vertical axis results in the configuration shown in Option B.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{B}\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nB",
