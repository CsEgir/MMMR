    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nAmong the following options, the one that conforms to the change rule of the given graph is: ().\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of symbols in the top row and then determine which option in the bottom row follows that same rule.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given sequence\nThe sequence in the top row is:\n1. üåä (Wave-like symbol)\n2. A (Letter \"A\")\n3. ‚òØ (Yin-Yang symbol)\n4. ‚òê (Square with a diagonal line)\n5. ‚ö° (Lightning bolt)\n\nWe need to observe how these symbols change from one to the next.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the transformation rule\nLet's examine the changes between consecutive symbols:\n\n- **From üåä to A**: The wave-like symbol transforms into a straight-line structure (the letter \"A\").\n- **From A to ‚òØ**: The straight-line structure transforms into a circular, symmetrical design (the Yin-Yang symbol).\n- **From ‚òØ to ‚òê**: The circular design transforms into a square shape with a diagonal line.\n- **From ‚òê to ‚ö°**: The square shape with a diagonal line transforms into a zigzag pattern (lightning bolt).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the next symbol\nThe sequence appears to follow a pattern where each symbol undergoes a transformation in its structure:\n1. From a wavy, curved shape to a straight-line structure.\n2. From a straight-line structure to a circular, symmetrical design.\n3. From a circular design to a square shape.\n4. From a square shape to a zigzag pattern.\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next symbol should transform from a zigzag pattern into a new structure. Let's analyze the options:\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the options\n- **Option A**: ‚úï (Cross symbol)\n  - This is a simple cross, which does not seem to logically follow the zigzag pattern.\n  \n- **Option B**: ‚ò∞ (Trigram symbol)\n  - This is a trigram, which is a more complex structure but does not directly follow the zigzag pattern.\n  \n- **Option C**: ÂçÅ (Chinese character for \"ten\")\n  - This is a plus sign, which is a simple structure but does not directly follow the zigzag pattern.\n  \n- **Option D**: ‚òê (Square symbol)\n  - This is a square, which could be seen as a simpler, more basic structure following the zigzag pattern.\n\n### Step 5: Choose the most logical option\nThe most logical transformation from a zigzag pattern (‚ö°) would be to a simpler, more basic structure. Among the options, the square (‚òê) fits this description best.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nC",
