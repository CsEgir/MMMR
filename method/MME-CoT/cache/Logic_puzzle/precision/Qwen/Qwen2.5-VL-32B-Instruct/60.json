    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nFrom the following four figures, find one figure with different patterns from the other three ().\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the patterns in each figure and identify any differences. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Figures\nEach figure consists of a 2x2 grid with symbols in each cell. The symbols are:\n- A lightning bolt (⚡)\n- An arrow pointing clockwise (↻)\n\nWe will examine the arrangement of these symbols in each figure.\n\n#### Figure A:\n```\n+---+---+\n|   | ⚡ |\n+---+---+\n| ⚡ | ↻ |\n+---+---+\n```\n\n#### Figure B:\n```\n+---+---+\n| ⚡ | ⚡ |\n+---+---+\n|   | ↻ |\n+---+---+\n```\n\n#### Figure C:\n```\n+---+---+\n| ⚡ |   |\n+---+---+\n|   | ↻ |\n+---+---+\n```\n\n#### Figure D:\n```\n+---+---+\n| ⚡ |   |\n+---+---+\n| ↻ | ⚡ |\n+---+---+\n```\n\n### Step 2: Identify Patterns\nNow, let's look for any consistent patterns or rules that might help us distinguish one figure from the others.\n\n#### Observation 1: Distribution of Symbols\n- In Figures A, B, and C, the arrow (↻) appears only once in the bottom-right cell.\n- In Figure D, the arrow (↻) is in the bottom-left cell, which is different from the other three figures.\n\n#### Observation 2: Placement of Lightning Bolts (⚡)\n- In Figures A, B, and C, the lightning bolts are distributed such that there is at least one empty cell in the grid.\n- In Figure D, all cells except the bottom-left one contain either a lightning bolt or an arrow.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Odd One Out\nFrom the observations:\n- Figures A, B, and C share a common pattern where the arrow is consistently placed in the bottom-right cell.\n- Figure D breaks this pattern by placing the arrow in the bottom-left cell and having a different distribution of symbols.\n\nThus, **Figure D** is the one with a different pattern from the other three.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nB",
