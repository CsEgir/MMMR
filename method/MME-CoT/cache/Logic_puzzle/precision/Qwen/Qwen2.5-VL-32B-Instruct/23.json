    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nWhich option from A-E should replace the question mark to follow the pattern present above the separating line? (select from A-E)\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence of shapes above the separating line and then determine which option from A-E follows that pattern.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given sequence\nThe sequence above the separating line is as follows:\n1. A square with a diagonal striped pattern containing a solid circle.\n2. A square with a diagonal striped pattern containing a hollow circle.\n3. A square with a diagonal striped pattern containing a partially filled circle (half shaded).\n4. A square with a diagonal striped pattern containing a small solid circle.\n5. A square with a diagonal striped pattern containing a hollow circle.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the pattern\nLet's observe the changes in the circles:\n- The first circle is **solid**.\n- The second circle is **hollow**.\n- The third circle is **partially filled**.\n- The fourth circle is **small and solid**.\n- The fifth circle is **hollow**.\n\nThe pattern appears to alternate between different states of the circle:\n1. Solid\n2. Hollow\n3. Partially filled\n4. Small and solid\n5. Hollow\n\n### Step 3: Determine the next shape\nFollowing the pattern:\n- After a hollow circle (fifth shape), the next shape should be a **solid circle**.\n\n### Step 4: Match the pattern to the options\nNow, let's examine the options A-E:\n- **A**: A square with a diagonal striped pattern containing a solid circle.\n- **B**: A square with a diagonal striped pattern containing a hollow circle.\n- **C**: A square with a diagonal striped pattern containing a partially filled circle.\n- **D**: A square with a diagonal striped pattern containing a small solid circle.\n- **E**: A square with a diagonal striped pattern containing a solid circle.\n\nBoth **A** and **E** contain a solid circle, but since the pattern alternates and the last shape was hollow, the next shape should be solid. Both **A** and **E** fit this description, but typically in such problems, there is only one correct answer. Given the identical nature of **A** and **E**, either could be correct based on the information provided. However, if we assume no redundancy in the options, we can select one.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{A}\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nA",
