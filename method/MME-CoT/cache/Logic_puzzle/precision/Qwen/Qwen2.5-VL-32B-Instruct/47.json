Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nThe mirror only exists when the Self is projected onto it.  Select from A, B and C. (A) True (B)False (C)Insufficient Information\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo analyze the statement \"The mirror only exists when the Self is projected onto it,\" let's carefully examine the provided text and its implications step by step.\n\n### Key Points from the Provided Text:\n1. **All mirrors reflect the Self**: This suggests that mirrors are inherently tied to the concept of the Self. They do not exist independently of the Self but rather serve as a medium for the Self to perceive itself.\n   \n2. **Objects exist as Things-in-themselves**: This implies that there are entities (Things-in-themselves) that exist independently of any projection or perception by the Self.\n\n3. **The Self projects onto Objects**: The Self interacts with the world by projecting onto objects, which means the Self influences how objects are perceived.\n\n4. **The mirror is an Object**: This categorizes the mirror as an object in the world, subject to the rules governing objects.\n\n5. **Only Things-in-themselves exist without a projection from the self**: This indicates that true existence, free from the influence of the Self, is reserved for Things-in-themselves.\n\n### Analysis of the Statement:\n- The statement claims that \"The mirror only exists when the Self is projected onto it.\" This suggests that the mirror's existence is contingent on the Self's interaction with it.\n  \n- From the provided text, we know that the mirror is an Object, and Objects exist as Things-in-themselves. However, the mirror's function (reflecting the Self) is explicitly tied to the Self's projection. Without the Self projecting onto it, the mirror would not fulfill its purpose of reflecting the Self.\n\n- While the mirror as an Object may exist independently as a Thing-in-itself, its role as a reflective surface is entirely dependent on the Self's projection. In this sense, the mirror's *functional existence* (as a tool for self-reflection) is indeed tied to the Self.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the emphasis on the mirror's role in reflecting the Self and the dependency of this function on the Self's projection, the statement is consistent with the provided text. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{A}\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nB",

They are marked as `N/A` since they do not involve logical inferences or image descriptions.\n2. **Logical Inference Steps**: Each step carefully breaks down the reasoning process, ensuring that each conclusion is directly entailed by the premises or ground truth. The judgments are marked as `Match` because each step aligns with the provided text and does not contradict any ground truth.\n3. **Final Answer Step**: The final step concludes that the statement is consistent with the provided text, leading to the answer `\\\\boxed{A}`.\n\nThis reformatted solution adheres to the requirements of atomicity, no duplication, and clear separation of step types. Each step is evaluated against the ground truth, ensuring correctness and alignment with the problem's context.",
