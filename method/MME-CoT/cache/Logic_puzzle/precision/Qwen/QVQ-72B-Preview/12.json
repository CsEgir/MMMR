The grid seems to be made up of squares with either black or white squares arranged in different patterns. There are four options provided: A, B, C, and D. My task is to choose the one that continues the pattern or fits into the empty space appropriately.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the pattern in the existing cells of the grid. Let's look at the top row:\n\n- The first cell has two squares: one white at the top left and one black below it.\n\n- The second cell has three squares: one black in the top middle, and two white squares to its right.\n\n- The third cell has two squares: one black on the top right and one white below it.\n\nMoving to the middle row:\n\n- The first cell has two squares: one white on the left and one black below it.\n\n- The second cell has three squares: all white, arranged horizontally in the center.\n\n- The third cell has three squares: one black on the top right, one white next to it, and one black at the bottom right.\n\nIn the bottom row:\n\n- The first cell has three squares: all white, stacked vertically on the left.\n\n- The second cell has three squares: one black in the middle, and two black squares below it.\n\n- The question mark is in the third cell of the bottom row.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA: A black square on the top left and three white squares below it.\n\nB: Four white squares arranged in a 2x2 grid.\n\nC: Three black squares on the top left and one white square below.\n\nD: One white square on the top left and three black squares below it.\n\nI need to determine which of these fits best into the question mark position.\n\nLet's try to identify any patterns or rules that govern the arrangement of squares in the grid.\n\nOne possible pattern is the alternation of colors or the number of squares in each cell. For example, in the top row, the first cell has two squares (one white, one black), the second has three squares (one black, two white), and the third has two squares (one black, one white). There doesn't seem to be a straightforward alternation in the number of squares or colors.\n\nIn the middle row, the first cell has two squares (white on top, black below), the second has three white squares in the center, and the third has three squares (black, white, black) arranged diagonally or in some other manner.\n\nThe bottom row has three white squares stacked vertically on the left, three squares (black, black, black) in the middle, and the question mark on the right.\n\nPerhaps the pattern involves the number of squares in each cell or their colors based on their position in the row or column.\n\nLet's consider the number of squares in each cell:\n\n- Top row: 2 squares, 3 squares, 2 squares\n\n- Middle row: 2 squares, 3 squares, 3 squares\n\n- Bottom row: 3 squares, 3 squares, ?\n\nFrom this, it seems that the first cell in each row has 2 squares, and the second and third cells have 3 squares, except for the bottom right cell, which is the question mark.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the question mark should have 3 squares, similar to the other cells in its row.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA: 4 squares (black and white)\n\nB: 4 squares (all white)\n\nC: 4 squares (three black, one white)\n\nD: 4 squares (one white, three black)\n\nWait, but the other cells in the bottom row have 3 squares each, so maybe the question mark should also have 3 squares to maintain consistency.\n\nHowever, option A shows 4 squares, which might not fit the pattern if the other cells in the row have 3 squares.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of squares is not the determining factor, and it's more about the arrangement or the colors.\n\nAnother approach could be to look at the arrangement of black and white squares.\n\nIn the top row:\n\n- First cell: white on top, black below\n\n- Second cell: black in the middle, two white squares to its right\n\n- Third cell: black on top right, white below\n\nMiddle row:\n\n- First cell: white on left, black below\n\n- Second cell: three white squares in the center\n\n- Third cell: black on top right, white next to it, black at bottom right\n\nBottom row:\n\n- First cell: three white squares stacked vertically on the left\n\n- Second cell: three black squares, possibly stacked vertically in the middle\n\n- Third cell: question mark\n\nPerhaps the pattern in the bottom row is to have squares stacked vertically.\n\nFirst cell: three white squares vertically on the left.\n\nSecond cell: three black squares, possibly vertically in the middle.\n\nThird cell: maybe three squares vertically on the right.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA: four squares, not matching the vertical stack pattern.\n\nB: four white squares in a 2x2 grid, which isn't a vertical stack.\n\nC: four squares, again not matching the vertical stack.\n\nD: four squares, not a vertical stack.\n\nWait, but none of the options show three squares stacked vertically.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question mark should have three squares stacked horizontally or in another arrangement.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of squares increases by one in each subsequent cell of the row.\n\nBottom row:\n\n- First cell: three squares\n\n- Second cell: three squares\n\n- Third cell: perhaps four squares\n\nBut that doesn't align with the observed pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of black squares increases or decreases in some manner.\n\nIn the bottom row:\n\n- First cell: three white squares\n\n- Second cell: three black squares\n\n- Third cell: maybe three white squares again, or three black squares, or a mix.\n\nOption A has four squares, which doesn't match.\n\nOption B has four white squares, which is more than the other cells.\n\nOption C has four squares, again more than needed.\n\nOption D has four squares, not matching.\n\nPerhaps the question mark should have three squares, similar to the other cells in the row.\n\nIf that's the case, then none of the options directly provide three squares.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the question mark cell should have three squares, and among the options, I need to choose the one that can be interpreted as having three squares.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question mark should have four squares, following some other pattern.\n\nLet's consider the entire grid's arrangement.\n\nThe grid is divided into nine cells, each containing a certain number of squares.\n\nPerhaps there's a pattern based on the total number of black and white squares across the grid.\n\nLet's count the black and white squares in each row.\n\nTop row:\n\n- First cell: one white and one black\n\n- Second cell: one black and two white\n\n- Third cell: one black and one white\n\nTotal black: 1 + 1 + 1 = 3\n\nTotal white: 1 + 2 + 1 = 4\n\nMiddle row:\n\n- First cell: one white and one black\n\n- Second cell: three white\n\n- Third cell: one black, one white, one black\n\nTotal black: 1 + 0 + 2 = 3\n\nTotal white: 1 + 3 + 1 = 5\n\nBottom row:\n\n- First cell: three white\n\n- Second cell: three black\n\n- Third cell: question mark\n\nIf the question mark cell has, say, three white squares, then total black would be 3 + 0 + 0 = 3, and total white would be 3 + 0 + 3 = 6.\n\nAlternatively, if it has three black squares, total black would be 3 + 3 + 3 = 9, and total white would be 3 + 0 + 0 = 3.\n\nBut I'm not sure if there's a specific pattern in the totals across the rows.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is based on the arrangement of squares within each cell.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA: A black square on the top left and three white squares below it.\n\nB: Four white squares arranged in a 2x2 grid.\n\nC: Three black squares on the top left and one white square below.\n\nD: One white square on the top left and three black squares below it.\n\nIf I consider the bottom row's theme is having squares stacked vertically, perhaps option D, which has one white square on top and three black squares below, could fit, but it's showing four squares instead of three.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the question mark should have three black squares to match the second cell in the bottom row, which has three black squares.\n\nBut none of the options show exactly three black squares without any white ones.\n\nOption C has three black squares and one white square, which might be too many.\n\nOption D has one white square and three black squares, which could be considered as four squares, not matching the three-square pattern of the row.\n\nOption B has four white squares, which doesn't fit.\n\nOption A has one black square and three white squares, which again doesn't match.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the question mark should have three white squares to contrast with the second cell's three black squares.\n\nBut again, none of the options present exactly three white squares without any black ones.\n\nOption B has four white squares, which is not matching.\n\nOption D has one white and three black squares, which is not three white squares.\n\nOption C has three black and one white, which is also not three white squares.\n\nOption A has one black and three white, which is close but still not exactly three white squares.\n\nPerhaps the pattern isn't strictly about the number of squares but about the arrangement or the colors in a specific way.\n\nAnother approach could be to look at the positions where black and white squares are placed within each cell.\n\nFor example, in some cells, black squares are on top, and white squares are below, or vice versa.\n\nIn the top row:\n\n- First cell: white on top, black below\n\n- Second cell: black in the middle, two white squares to its right\n\n- Third cell: black on top right, white below\n\nMiddle row:\n\n- First cell: white on left, black below\n\n- Second cell: three white squares in the center\n\n- Third cell: black on top right, white next to it, black at bottom right\n\nBottom row:\n\n- First cell: three white squares stacked vertically on the left\n\n- Second cell: three black squares, possibly stacked vertically in the middle\n\n- Third cell: question mark\n\nPerhaps the question mark should have three squares stacked vertically on the right side, similar to the first and second cells in the bottom row.\n\nIf that's the case, then none of the options directly show three squares stacked vertically.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the arrangement is horizontal.\n\nLooking back at the options, option D shows one white square on top left and three black squares below it, which could be interpreted as four squares arranged vertically.\n\nIf that's the case, then perhaps the question mark should have four squares arranged vertically: one white on top and three black below.\n\nThis might fit the pattern of having vertical arrangements in the bottom row.\n\nHowever, the other cells in the bottom row have three squares each, so having four in the third cell might break the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is evolving to have increasing numbers of squares in each cell of the row.\n\nBut in the bottom row, the first cell has three white squares, the second has three black squares, and the third could have four squares, perhaps as a culmination.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the number of squares should remain consistent across the row.\n\nGiven that, perhaps the question mark should have three squares, all white, to contrast with the second cell's three black squares.\n\nBut again, none of the options show exactly three white squares without any black ones.\n\nOption B has four white squares, which doesn't match.\n\nOption D has one white and three black squares, which is not\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nB",
