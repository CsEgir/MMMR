Each figure is divided into a 2x2 grid, and inside these grids, there are some symbols: a lightning bolt and a swirl, each with a small circle indicating rotation. The task is to identify which one of these figures has a different pattern compared to the other three.\n\nFirst, I need to carefully observe each figure and note the positions and orientations of the symbols.\n\nStarting with Figure A:\n\n- Top-left cell: A swirl with a small circle, suggesting rotation.\n\n- Top-right cell: A lightning bolt with a small circle, also indicating rotation.\n\n- Bottom-left cell: Another swirl with a small circle.\n\n- Bottom-right cell: Another lightning bolt with a small circle.\n\nSo, in Figure A, both the top and bottom cells have a swirl and a lightning bolt, each paired with a rotation symbol.\n\nNow, moving on to Figure B:\n\n- Top-left cell: A lightning bolt with a small circle.\n\n- Top-right cell: A swirl with a small circle.\n\n- Bottom-left cell: Another lightning bolt with a small circle.\n\n- Bottom-right cell: Another swirl with a small circle.\n\nHere, the pattern seems similar to Figure A, but the positions are mirrored horizontally. That is, the lightning bolt and swirl have swapped places in the top row compared to Figure A.\n\nNext, Figure C:\n\n- Top-left cell: A swirl with a small circle.\n\n- Top-right cell: A lightning bolt with a small circle.\n\n- Bottom-left cell: Another swirl with a small circle.\n\n- Bottom-right cell: Another lightning bolt with a small circle.\n\nThis looks like Figure B but without any horizontal mirroring. The positions are similar to Figure A but with swapped top-row elements.\n\nWait, actually, Figure C seems identical to Figure B. Let me double-check:\n\n- Figure B: Top-left: lightning bolt; Top-right: swirl; Bottom-left: lightning bolt; Bottom-right: swirl.\n\n- Figure C: Top-left: swirl; Top-right: lightning bolt; Bottom-left: swirl; Bottom-right: lightning bolt.\n\nOops, I made a mistake earlier. Figure C has swirls in the top-left and bottom-left cells, and lightning bolts in the top-right and bottom-right cells, each with rotation symbols.\n\nFinally, Figure D:\n\n- Top-left cell: A lightning bolt with a small circle.\n\n- Top-right cell: A swirl with a small circle.\n\n- Bottom-left cell: Another swirl with a small circle.\n\n- Bottom-right cell: Another lightning bolt with a small circle.\n\nThis appears similar to Figure B: lightning bolt and swirl in the top row, and swirl and lightning bolt in the bottom row, each with rotation symbols.\n\nNow, comparing all four figures:\n\n- Figure A: Swirl and lightning bolt in both top and bottom rows.\n\n- Figure B: Lightning bolt and swirl in the top row; swirl and lightning bolt in the bottom row.\n\n- Figure C: Swirl and lightning bolt in the top row; swirl and lightning bolt in the bottom row.\n\n- Figure D: Lightning bolt and swirl in the top row; swirl and lightning bolt in the bottom row.\n\nWait a minute, Figures B and D seem to have the same pattern. Maybe I need to look closer.\n\nBut hold on, Figure B has lightning bolt and swirl in the top row, and swirl and lightning bolt in the bottom row. Figure D has the same arrangement. Figure C has swirl and lightning bolt in both rows. Figure A has swirl and lightning bolt in both rows as well, but in Figure A, the top and bottom rows are identical, while in Figures B and D, the top and bottom rows are mirrors of each other horizontally.\n\nWait, no: in Figure B, the top row is lightning bolt and swirl, and bottom row is swirl and lightning bolt. In Figure D, it's the same. So Figures B and D are identical in their arrangement.\n\nFigure C has swirl and lightning bolt in both rows, which is different from Figure B and D, but similar to Figure A, except that Figure A has the same symbols in both rows, while Figure C has the same symbols in corresponding positions.\n\nI think I'm getting confused here. Let's try a different approach.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the symmetry or the sequence of symbols.\n\nLooking at Figures B and D, they both have lightning bolt and swirl in the top row, and swirl and lightning bolt in the bottom row. Figures A and C have swirl and lightning bolt in both rows.\n\nWait, but Figure A has swirl and lightning bolt in both rows, while Figure C has swirl and lightning bolt in both rows as well. So Figures A and C are similar in that both have the same symbols in each row, whereas Figures B and D have different symbols in each row.\n\nBut Figures B and D are identical in their arrangement.\n\nSo, between Figures A and C, both have swirl and lightning bolt in both rows, but in Figure A, the top and bottom rows are identical, while in Figure C, the top and bottom rows are also identical.\n\nWait, no: Figure C has swirl and lightning bolt in both rows, same as Figure A.\n\nSo Figures A and C are identical.\n\nSimilarly, Figures B and D are identical.\n\nSo now, it's between Figures A/C versus Figures B/D.\n\nBut the question asks for one figure that is different from the other three.\n\nIf Figures A and C are identical, and Figures B and D are identical, then the difference must be between these two pairs.\n\nSo, what's the difference between Figures A/C and Figures B/D?\n\nIn Figures A/C, the top row has swirl and lightning bolt, and the bottom row also has swirl and lightning bolt, in the same order.\n\nIn Figures B/D, the top row has lightning bolt and swirl, and the bottom row has swirl and lightning bolt.\n\nSo, Figures B/D have a different arrangement compared to Figures A/C.\n\nTherefore, Figures A and C are one type, and Figures B and D are another type.\n\nHence, either Figure B or Figure D would be the one with a different pattern compared to the other three.\n\nBut the problem states that one figure is different from the other three.\n\nWait, if Figures A and C are identical, and Figures B and D are identical, but Figures A/C differ from Figures B/D, then both B and D are different from A and C.\n\nSo, in this case, Figures B and D are the ones that differ from Figures A and C.\n\nTherefore, either Figure B or Figure D is the answer.\n\nBut the problem is to find one figure that is different from the other three.\n\nSo, if Figures A, C, and D are one type, and Figure B is different, then Figure B is the answer.\n\nWait, but Figures D and B are identical.\n\nWait, perhaps I need to look again.\n\nLet me check Figure B and Figure D:\n\nFigure B:\n\n- Top-left: lightning bolt with rotation.\n\n- Top-right: swirl with rotation.\n\n- Bottom-left: swirl with rotation.\n\n- Bottom-right: lightning bolt with rotation.\n\nFigure D:\n\n- Top-left: lightning bolt with rotation.\n\n- Top-right: swirl with rotation.\n\n- Bottom-left: swirl with rotation.\n\n- Bottom-right: lightning bolt with rotation.\n\nYes, Figures B and D are identical.\n\nSimilarly, Figure A:\n\n- Top-left: swirl with rotation.\n\n- Top-right: lightning bolt with rotation.\n\n- Bottom-left: swirl with rotation.\n\n- Bottom-right: lightning bolt with rotation.\n\nFigure C:\n\n- Top-left: swirl with rotation.\n\n- Top-right: lightning bolt with rotation.\n\n- Bottom-left: swirl with rotation.\n\n- Bottom-right: lightning bolt with rotation.\n\nWait, Figures A and C are identical.\n\nSo, Figures A and C are one type, and Figures B and D are another type.\n\nTherefore, the difference is between Figures A/C and Figures B/D.\n\nSo, Figures B and D are similar to each other but different from Figures A and C.\n\nTherefore, if the question is to find one figure that is different from the other three, it could be either Figure B or Figure D.\n\nBut since the problem likely expects a single answer, perhaps there is a specific reason to choose one over the other.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a mistake in my observation.\n\nLet me try another approach.\n\nMaybe I should consider the sequence of symbols in each row.\n\nIn Figure A:\n\n- Top row: swirl, lightning bolt.\n\n- Bottom row: swirl, lightning bolt.\n\nIn Figure B:\n\n- Top row: lightning bolt, swirl.\n\n- Bottom row: swirl, lightning bolt.\n\nIn Figure C:\n\n- Top row: swirl, lightning bolt.\n\n- Bottom row: swirl, lightning bolt.\n\nIn Figure D:\n\n- Top row: lightning bolt, swirl.\n\n- Bottom row: swirl, lightning bolt.\n\nSo, Figures A and C have the same top and bottom rows: swirl and lightning bolt.\n\nFigures B and D have top row as lightning bolt and swirl, and bottom row as swirl and lightning bolt.\n\nTherefore, Figures A and C are identical, and Figures B and D are identical.\n\nHence, the difference is between Figures A/C and Figures B/D.\n\nSo, if I have to pick one figure that is different from the other three, it could be either Figure B or Figure D.\n\nBut since the problem likely expects a single answer, perhaps the answer is Figure B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe there is a unique characteristic that sets one figure apart.\n\nWait, perhaps considering the sequence of symbols across the figures.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering the rotation symbols.\n\nIn all figures, each symbol has a small circle indicating rotation.\n\nSo, the rotation symbols are consistent across all figures.\n\nTherefore, the difference lies in the arrangement of the symbols themselves.\n\nGiven that, Figures A and C have swirl and lightning bolt in both rows, while Figures B and D have lightning bolt and swirl in the top row and swirl and lightning bolt in the bottom row.\n\nTherefore, Figures B and D share a pattern that is different from Figures A and C.\n\nHence, either Figure B or Figure D is the answer.\n\nBut since the problem likely expects a single answer, perhaps the answer is Figure B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a unique feature in one of the figures that I haven't considered yet.\n\nLet me check if there's any rotational symmetry or other patterns.\n\nIn Figure A:\n\n- Top row: swirl, lightning bolt.\n\n- Bottom row: swirl, lightning bolt.\n\nThis is symmetrical both horizontally and vertically.\n\nIn Figure B:\n\n- Top row: lightning bolt, swirl.\n\n- Bottom row: swirl, lightning bolt.\n\nThis is not symmetrical horizontally or vertically.\n\nIn Figure C:\n\n- Top row: swirl, lightning bolt.\n\n- Bottom row: swirl, lightning bolt.\n\nAgain, symmetrical horizontally and vertically.\n\nIn Figure D:\n\n- Top row: lightning bolt, swirl.\n\n- Bottom row: swirl, lightning bolt.\n\nNot symmetrical.\n\nTherefore, Figures A and C are symmetrical, while Figures B and D are not.\n\nHence, the difference is between symmetrical (A and C) and non-symmetrical (B and D).\n\nTherefore, Figures B and D are different from Figures A and C in terms of symmetry.\n\nHence, Figures B and D are the ones that are different from the other three.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be either Figure B or Figure D.\n\nBut since the problem likely expects a single answer, perhaps the answer is Figure B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there is a unique feature in one of the figures that makes only one figure different.\n\nWait, perhaps considering the sequence of symbols in a specific order.\n\nAlternatively, maybe considering the sequence as reading from top-left to bottom-right.\n\nLet's try that.\n\nFigure A:\n\n- Top-left: swirl.\n\n- Top-right: lightning bolt.\n\n- Bottom-left: swirl.\n\n- Bottom-right: lightning bolt.\n\nSequence: swirl, lightning bolt, swirl, lightning bolt.\n\nFigure B:\n\n- Top-left: lightning bolt.\n\n- Top-right: swirl.\n\n- Bottom-left: swirl.\n\n- Bottom-right: lightning bolt.\n\nSequence: lightning bolt, swirl, swirl, lightning bolt.\n\nFigure C:\n\n- Top-left: swirl.\n\n- Top-right: lightning bolt.\n\n- Bottom-left: swirl.\n\n- Bottom-right: lightning bolt.\n\nSequence:\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nB",
