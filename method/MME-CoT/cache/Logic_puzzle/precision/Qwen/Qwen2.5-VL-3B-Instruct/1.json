    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\n<image>The image displays an intelligence test question in the form of a matrix pattern puzzle. There are eight shapes provided, with one space left blank, indicated by a question mark. The shapes are organized into three rows, each containing three boxes. Your task is to select the correct shape from six options (labeled A to F) to fill the empty box, completing the pattern that links all the shapes together.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this matrix pattern puzzle, we need to identify the logical sequence or rule that connects all the shapes in the rows. Let's analyze each row:\n\n1. The first row has shapes: \\(\\bullet\\), \\(\\text{V}\\), and \\(\\text{T}\\).\n2. The second row has shapes: \\(\\text{V}\\), \\(\\text{T}\\), and \\(\\text{X}\\).\n3. The third row has shapes: \\(\\text{X}\\), \\(\\text{T}\\), and \\(\\text{V}\\).\n\nWe observe that the shapes in each row are arranged in a specific order:\n- First row: \\(\\bullet\\), \\(\\text{V}\\), \\(\\text{T}\\)\n- Second row: \\(\\text{V}\\), \\(\\text{T}\\), \\(\\text{X}\\)\n- Third row: \\(\\text{X}\\), \\(\\text{T}\\), \\(\\text{V}\\)\n\nThe pattern seems to be alternating between two types of shapes: one type appears in the first and third positions, and the other type appears in the second position.\n\nLooking at the options provided (A to F):\n- A: \\(\\text{V}\\) (appears in the second position)\n- B: \\(\\text{T}\\) (appears in the second position)\n- C: \\(\\text{X}\\) (appears in the third position)\n- D: \\(\\text{V}\\) (appears in the second position)\n- E: \\(\\text{T}\\) (appears in the second position)\n- F: \\(\\text{X}\\) (appears in the third position)\n\nBased on the observed pattern, the correct shape to fill the blank is the one that appears in the third position of the rows. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{C}\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nE",
