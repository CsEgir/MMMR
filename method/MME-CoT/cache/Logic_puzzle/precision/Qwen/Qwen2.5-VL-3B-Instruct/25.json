    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nYou are given a puzzle. The puzzle consists of a question part on the top and the choices in the bottom. The question part on the top is a set of visual grids arranged in a 3 by 1 sequence, with the last piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Based on a specific pattern, one option in the choice section can be classified into the same group as the question part, while the other three options are categorized into a different group. Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that governs the arrangement of shapes and symbols in the visual grids. Let's analyze the given context:\n\n1. The first grid has a square followed by a pentagon, then an arrow pointing right, and finally a square.\n2. The second grid has a triangle followed by a star, then a circle, and finally another triangle.\n\nThe missing part should follow the same pattern as the other two grids. Observing the patterns:\n- The first grid: Square → Pentagon → Arrow → Square\n- The second grid: Triangle → Star → Circle → Triangle\n\nWe can see that each grid alternates between different shapes and symbols. Therefore, the missing part should be a shape or symbol that follows the alternating sequence.\n\nNow, let's look at the choices:\n1. Square → Circle → Arrow → Square\n2. Square → Star → Star → Square\n3. Triangle → Circle → Circle → Triangle\n4. Pentagon → Hexagon → Hexagon → Pentagon\n\nAmong these choices, the one that fits the alternating pattern is Choice 1: Square → Circle → Arrow → Square.\n\nThus, the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part is \\boxed{1}.\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\n2",
