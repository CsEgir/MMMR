    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nBased on the diagram at the top of the page, which two of the proposals A, B, C or D completes the diagrams at the bottom of the page?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern or rule that is being applied in the given diagram. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the operations and their effects:**\n   - The first operation is a square with a circle inside it.\n   - The second operation is multiplication (×).\n   - The third operation is a diamond shape.\n\n2. **Apply the operations to the bottom diagrams:**\n\n   **First Diagram:**\n   - We start with a circle.\n   - Apply the multiplication operation: \\( \\times \\)\n   - The result should be a rectangle because multiplying a circle by a number results in a rectangle.\n\n3. **Second Diagram:**\n   - We start with a circle.\n   - Apply the diamond shape operation: \\( \\diamond \\)\n   - The result should be a half-circle because the diamond shape typically represents division or halving an object.\n\nNow, let's match these results with the provided options:\n\n- For the first diagram, the correct option is D (half-circle).\n- For the second diagram, the correct option is A (circle).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\boxed{A, D}\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nB, D",
