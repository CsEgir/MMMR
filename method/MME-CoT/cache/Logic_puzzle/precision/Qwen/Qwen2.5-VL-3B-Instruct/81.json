    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nWhat diagram replaces the question mark? Select from A, B, C, and D. (A) (B) (C) (D)\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo determine which diagram replaces the question mark, we need to analyze the given transformations and apply them to the initial sequence of symbols.\n\nThe initial sequence is: + IL\n\nThe transformations provided are:\n1. Switches the 2nd and 3rd symbols.\n2. Switches the 1st and 3rd symbols.\n3. Each symbol moves one place to the right.\n4. Each symbol moves one place to the left.\n\nLet's apply these transformations step by step:\n\n1. Start with + IL\n2. Apply the first transformation (switching the 2nd and 3rd symbols): I L +\n3. Apply the second transformation (switching the 1st and 3rd symbols): L I +\n4. Apply the third transformation (each symbol moves one place to the right): L I +\n5. Apply the fourth transformation (each symbol moves one place to the left): L I +\n\nNow, let's compare this result with the given options:\n\nA: \\(\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\\text { } & \\text { } \\\\ \\text { } & \\end{array}\\right.\\)\nB: \\(\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\\text { } & \\text { } \\\\ \\text { } & \\end{array}\\right.\\)\nC: \\(\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\\text { } & \\text { } \\\\ \\text { } & \\end{array}\\right.\\)\nD: \\(\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\\text { } & \\text { } \\\\ \\text { } & \\end{array}\\right.\\)\n\nAfter applying the transformations, we get L I +. This matches option D.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{D}.\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nB",
