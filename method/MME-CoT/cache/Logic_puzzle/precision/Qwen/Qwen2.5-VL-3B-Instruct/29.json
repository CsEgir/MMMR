    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nThe most appropriate way to fill in the question mark is ().\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo determine the most appropriate way to fill in the question mark, we need to analyze the pattern or rule that governs the sequence of shapes.\n\nLet's examine the given shapes:\n\n1. The first shape is a square with 4 dots.\n2. The second shape is a rectangle with 6 dots.\n3. The third shape is a square with 8 dots.\n4. The fourth shape is a rectangle with 10 dots.\n\nWe can observe that each shape increases by 2 dots from the previous one:\n- From the first shape (4 dots) to the second shape (6 dots), there is an increase of 2 dots.\n- From the second shape (6 dots) to the third shape (8 dots), there is another increase of 2 dots.\n- From the third shape (8 dots) to the fourth shape (10 dots), there is yet another increase of 2 dots.\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next shape should have 12 dots (since 10 + 2 = 12).\n\nNow, let's look at the options provided:\nA. A shape with 12 dots\nB. A shape with 14 dots\nC. A shape with 16 dots\nD. A shape with 18 dots\n\nSince the pattern shows an increase of 2 dots each time, and the last shape has 10 dots, the next shape should have 12 dots.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{A}.\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nC",
