    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, evaluate the relevance to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) of each step.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Relevancy\nA relevant step is considered as: 75% content of the step must be related to trying to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) to the question. \n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: \nEvaluate relevancy independent of correctness. As long as the step is trying to get to a solution, it is considered relevant. Logical fallacy, knowledge mistake, inconsistent with previous steps, or other mistakes do not affect relevance.\nA logically wrong step can be relevant if the reasoning attempts to address the question.\n\nThe following behaviour is considered as relevant:\ni. The step is planning, summarizing, thinking, verifying, calculating, or confirming an intermediate/final conclusion helpful to get a solution.\nii. The step is summarizing or reflecting on previously reached conclusion relevant to get a solution.\niii. Repeating the information in the question or give the final answer.\niv. A relevant image depiction shoule be in one of following situation: 1. help to obtain a conclusion helpful to solve the question later; 2. help to identify certain patterns in the image later; 3. directly contributes to the answer\nv. Depicting or analyzing the options of the question is also relevant.\nvi. Repeating previous relevant steps are also considered relevant. \n\nThe following behaviour is considered as irrelevant: \ni. Depicting image information that does not related to what is asking in the question.  Example: The question asks how many cars are present in all the images. If the step focuses on other visual elements like the road or building, the step is considered as irrelevant.\nii. Self-thought not related to what the question is asking.\niii. Other information that is tangential for answering the question.\n\n\n# Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"A brief summary of step result\",\n    \"relevant\": \"Yes|No\"\n  }\n]\n\n\n# Output Rules\nDirect JSON output without any other output\nOutput at most 40 steps\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\n<image>The image displays an intelligence test question in the form of a matrix pattern puzzle. There are eight shapes provided, with one space left blank, indicated by a question mark. The shapes are organized into three rows, each containing three boxes. Your task is to select the correct shape from six options (labeled A to F) to fill the empty box, completing the pattern that links all the shapes together.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this matrix pattern puzzle, we need to identify the underlying rules governing the arrangement of shapes in the rows and columns. Let's analyze the given matrix step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Rows\nThe matrix has three rows, each containing three boxes. We will examine the patterns within each row.\n\n#### Row 1:\n- Box 1: A vertical line with a purple square on the left.\n- Box 2: A single vertical line.\n- Box 3: A vertical line with a purple square on the right.\n\n#### Row 2:\n- Box 1: A single vertical line.\n- Box 2: Two vertical lines.\n- Box 3: Three vertical lines.\n\n#### Row 3:\n- Box 1: A vertical line with a purple square on the left.\n- Box 2: Two vertical lines.\n- Box 3: (Blank, indicated by a question mark).\n\n### Step 2: Identify Patterns\nFrom the analysis of the rows, we can observe the following patterns:\n\n1. **Vertical Lines**:\n   - Row 1: 1 line → 1 line → 1 line.\n   - Row 2: 1 line → 2 lines → 3 lines.\n   - Row 3: 1 line → 2 lines → ? lines.\n     - The number of vertical lines increases by 1 in each subsequent box within a row.\n\n2. **Purple Squares**:\n   - Row 1: Purple square on the left → No square → Purple square on the right.\n   - Row 2: No square → No square → No square.\n   - Row 3: Purple square on the left → No square → ?\n     - The presence of purple squares alternates between rows and follows a specific side pattern.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Missing Shape\nUsing the observed patterns:\n- In Row 3, the number of vertical lines should increase sequentially: 1 → 2 → 3.\n- The purple square alternates sides and is present in the first box of Row 3. Following this pattern, the third box should have a purple square on the right.\n\nThus, the missing shape should have:\n- 3 vertical lines.\n- A purple square on the right.\n\n### Step 4: Match the Options\nNow, let's match these characteristics with the provided options (A to F):\n- **Option A**: 1 vertical line, purple square on the left.\n- **Option B**: 1 vertical line, no square.\n- **Option C**: 1 vertical line, purple square on the right.\n- **Option D**: 1 vertical line, purple square on the left.\n- **Option E**: 3 vertical lines, no square.\n- **Option F**: 3 vertical lines, purple square on the right.\n\nThe correct shape is **Option F**, which has 3 vertical lines and a purple square on the right.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{F}",
