    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, evaluate the relevance to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) of each step.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Relevancy\nA relevant step is considered as: 75% content of the step must be related to trying to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) to the question. \n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: \nEvaluate relevancy independent of correctness. As long as the step is trying to get to a solution, it is considered relevant. Logical fallacy, knowledge mistake, inconsistent with previous steps, or other mistakes do not affect relevance.\nA logically wrong step can be relevant if the reasoning attempts to address the question.\n\nThe following behaviour is considered as relevant:\ni. The step is planning, summarizing, thinking, verifying, calculating, or confirming an intermediate/final conclusion helpful to get a solution.\nii. The step is summarizing or reflecting on previously reached conclusion relevant to get a solution.\niii. Repeating the information in the question or give the final answer.\niv. A relevant image depiction shoule be in one of following situation: 1. help to obtain a conclusion helpful to solve the question later; 2. help to identify certain patterns in the image later; 3. directly contributes to the answer\nv. Depicting or analyzing the options of the question is also relevant.\nvi. Repeating previous relevant steps are also considered relevant. \n\nThe following behaviour is considered as irrelevant: \ni. Depicting image information that does not related to what is asking in the question.  Example: The question asks how many cars are present in all the images. If the step focuses on other visual elements like the road or building, the step is considered as irrelevant.\nii. Self-thought not related to what the question is asking.\niii. Other information that is tangential for answering the question.\n\n\n# Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"A brief summary of step result\",\n    \"relevant\": \"Yes|No\"\n  }\n]\n\n\n# Output Rules\nDirect JSON output without any other output\nOutput at most 40 steps\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nFrom the following four figures, find one figure with different patterns from the other three ().\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the patterns in each figure and identify any differences. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Figures\nEach figure consists of a 2x2 grid with symbols in each cell. The symbols are:\n- A lightning bolt (⚡)\n- An arrow pointing clockwise (↻)\n\nWe will examine the arrangement of these symbols in each figure.\n\n#### Figure A:\n```\n+---+---+\n|   | ⚡ |\n+---+---+\n| ⚡ | ↻ |\n+---+---+\n```\n\n#### Figure B:\n```\n+---+---+\n| ⚡ | ⚡ |\n+---+---+\n|   | ↻ |\n+---+---+\n```\n\n#### Figure C:\n```\n+---+---+\n| ⚡ |   |\n+---+---+\n|   | ↻ |\n+---+---+\n```\n\n#### Figure D:\n```\n+---+---+\n| ⚡ |   |\n+---+---+\n| ↻ | ⚡ |\n+---+---+\n```\n\n### Step 2: Identify Patterns\nNow, let's look for any consistent patterns or rules that might help us distinguish one figure from the others.\n\n#### Observation 1: Distribution of Symbols\n- In Figures A, B, and C, the arrow (↻) appears only once in the bottom-right cell.\n- In Figure D, the arrow (↻) is in the bottom-left cell, which is different from the other three figures.\n\n#### Observation 2: Placement of Lightning Bolts (⚡)\n- In Figures A, B, and C, the lightning bolts are distributed such that there is at least one empty cell in the grid.\n- In Figure D, all cells except the bottom-left one contain either a lightning bolt or an arrow.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Odd One Out\nFrom the observations:\n- Figures A, B, and C share a common pattern where the arrow is consistently placed in the bottom-right cell.\n- Figure D breaks this pattern by placing the arrow in the bottom-left cell and having a different distribution of symbols.\n\nThus, **Figure D** is the one with a different pattern from the other three.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}",
