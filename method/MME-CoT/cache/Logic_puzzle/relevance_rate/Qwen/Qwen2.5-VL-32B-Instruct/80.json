    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, evaluate the relevance to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) of each step.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Relevancy\nA relevant step is considered as: 75% content of the step must be related to trying to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) to the question. \n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: \nEvaluate relevancy independent of correctness. As long as the step is trying to get to a solution, it is considered relevant. Logical fallacy, knowledge mistake, inconsistent with previous steps, or other mistakes do not affect relevance.\nA logically wrong step can be relevant if the reasoning attempts to address the question.\n\nThe following behaviour is considered as relevant:\ni. The step is planning, summarizing, thinking, verifying, calculating, or confirming an intermediate/final conclusion helpful to get a solution.\nii. The step is summarizing or reflecting on previously reached conclusion relevant to get a solution.\niii. Repeating the information in the question or give the final answer.\niv. A relevant image depiction shoule be in one of following situation: 1. help to obtain a conclusion helpful to solve the question later; 2. help to identify certain patterns in the image later; 3. directly contributes to the answer\nv. Depicting or analyzing the options of the question is also relevant.\nvi. Repeating previous relevant steps are also considered relevant. \n\nThe following behaviour is considered as irrelevant: \ni. Depicting image information that does not related to what is asking in the question.  Example: The question asks how many cars are present in all the images. If the step focuses on other visual elements like the road or building, the step is considered as irrelevant.\nii. Self-thought not related to what the question is asking.\niii. Other information that is tangential for answering the question.\n\n\n# Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"A brief summary of step result\",\n    \"relevant\": \"Yes|No\"\n  }\n]\n\n\n# Output Rules\nDirect JSON output without any other output\nOutput at most 40 steps\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nWhich set does the Figure belong to? Select from A, B, and C. (A) Set A (B) Set B (C) Neither set A nor set B\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo determine which set the Figure belongs to, let's analyze the characteristics of Set A and Set B, as well as the Figure itself.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Set A\nSet A consists of shapes that have a horizontal line with a vertical line attached to it. The vertical line can be positioned at various locations along the horizontal line:\n- The vertical line can be at the left end.\n- The vertical line can be in the middle.\n- The vertical line can be at the right end.\n- The vertical line can be offset from the ends or the middle.\n\nExamples from Set A:\n- A \"T\" shape where the vertical line is centered.\n- A shape where the vertical line is at the left end.\n- A shape where the vertical line is at the right end.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Set B\nSet B consists of shapes that have a vertical line with a horizontal line attached to it. The horizontal line can be positioned at various locations along the vertical line:\n- The horizontal line can be at the top.\n- The horizontal line can be in the middle.\n- The horizontal line can be at the bottom.\n- The horizontal line can be offset from the top, middle, or bottom.\n\nExamples from Set B:\n- An \"L\" shape where the horizontal line is at the bottom.\n- A shape where the horizontal line is at the top.\n- A shape where the horizontal line is in the middle.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Figure\nThe Figure shows a shape with a horizontal line and a vertical line attached to it. Specifically:\n- The horizontal line is longer and spans the entire width of the shape.\n- The vertical line is shorter and is attached to the horizontal line near the center.\n\nThis configuration matches the pattern seen in Set A, where the horizontal line is the primary feature with a vertical line attached to it.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Figure to Sets A and B\n- The Figure fits the pattern of Set A, where the horizontal line is the main component with a vertical line attached.\n- The Figure does not fit the pattern of Set B, where the vertical line is the main component with a horizontal line attached.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe Figure belongs to Set A.\n\n\\boxed{A}",
