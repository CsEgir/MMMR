    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, evaluate the relevance to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) of each step.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Relevancy\nA relevant step is considered as: 75% content of the step must be related to trying to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) to the question. \n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: \nEvaluate relevancy independent of correctness. As long as the step is trying to get to a solution, it is considered relevant. Logical fallacy, knowledge mistake, inconsistent with previous steps, or other mistakes do not affect relevance.\nA logically wrong step can be relevant if the reasoning attempts to address the question.\n\nThe following behaviour is considered as relevant:\ni. The step is planning, summarizing, thinking, verifying, calculating, or confirming an intermediate/final conclusion helpful to get a solution.\nii. The step is summarizing or reflecting on previously reached conclusion relevant to get a solution.\niii. Repeating the information in the question or give the final answer.\niv. A relevant image depiction shoule be in one of following situation: 1. help to obtain a conclusion helpful to solve the question later; 2. help to identify certain patterns in the image later; 3. directly contributes to the answer\nv. Depicting or analyzing the options of the question is also relevant.\nvi. Repeating previous relevant steps are also considered relevant. \n\nThe following behaviour is considered as irrelevant: \ni. Depicting image information that does not related to what is asking in the question.  Example: The question asks how many cars are present in all the images. If the step focuses on other visual elements like the road or building, the step is considered as irrelevant.\nii. Self-thought not related to what the question is asking.\niii. Other information that is tangential for answering the question.\n\n\n# Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"A brief summary of step result\",\n    \"relevant\": \"Yes|No\"\n  }\n]\n\n\n# Output Rules\nDirect JSON output without any other output\nOutput at most 40 steps\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nAccording to the following graph rule, the question mark is filled in with ().\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the pattern and transformation rules in the sequence of shapes provided. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given sequence\nThe sequence of shapes is:\n1. A parallelogram with a diagonal cross.\n2. A rhombus (diamond shape).\n3. A trapezoid with a smaller rectangle on top.\n4. A square.\n\nWe need to determine the next shape in the sequence, which will replace the question mark.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the transformation rule\nLet's examine the changes between each pair of consecutive shapes:\n\n- **From Shape 1 to Shape 2**:\n  - The parallelogram becomes a rhombus.\n  - The diagonal cross disappears.\n  - This suggests a transformation from a general parallelogram to a more specific type of parallelogram (rhombus) and the removal of internal details.\n\n- **From Shape 2 to Shape 3**:\n  - The rhombus transforms into a trapezoid.\n  - A smaller rectangle is added on top.\n  - This suggests a change in the overall shape (from a quadrilateral with equal sides to a trapezoid) and the addition of a new element (the smaller rectangle).\n\n- **From Shape 3 to Shape 4**:\n  - The trapezoid with a smaller rectangle on top transforms into a square.\n  - The smaller rectangle disappears.\n  - This suggests a simplification of the shape (from a complex trapezoid to a simple square) and the removal of the additional element.\n\n### Step 3: Predict the next shape\nBased on the observed pattern:\n1. The shapes are transforming in a cyclic manner, alternating between adding and removing elements or changing the overall shape.\n2. The sequence seems to follow a pattern of simplification and complexity alternately.\n\nGiven that the last shape (Shape 4) is a simple square, the next shape should introduce some complexity or a new element. Looking at the options:\n\n- **Option A**: A curved arrow. This does not fit the pattern of geometric shapes.\n- **Option B**: A circle with a star-like pattern inside. This introduces a new, complex shape with internal details.\n- **Option C**: A cross shape. This is a simple geometric shape but does not match the complexity introduced in previous steps.\n- **Option D**: A trapezoid with a smaller rectangle on top. This is a repetition of Shape 3, which does not fit the pattern of progression.\n\n### Step 4: Choose the correct answer\nThe most logical choice is **Option B**, as it introduces a new, complex shape with internal details, following the pattern of alternating simplicity and complexity.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{B}",
