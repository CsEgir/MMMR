    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, evaluate the relevance to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) of each step.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Relevancy\nA relevant step is considered as: 75% content of the step must be related to trying to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) to the question. \n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: \nEvaluate relevancy independent of correctness. As long as the step is trying to get to a solution, it is considered relevant. Logical fallacy, knowledge mistake, inconsistent with previous steps, or other mistakes do not affect relevance.\nA logically wrong step can be relevant if the reasoning attempts to address the question.\n\nThe following behaviour is considered as relevant:\ni. The step is planning, summarizing, thinking, verifying, calculating, or confirming an intermediate/final conclusion helpful to get a solution.\nii. The step is summarizing or reflecting on previously reached conclusion relevant to get a solution.\niii. Repeating the information in the question or give the final answer.\niv. A relevant image depiction shoule be in one of following situation: 1. help to obtain a conclusion helpful to solve the question later; 2. help to identify certain patterns in the image later; 3. directly contributes to the answer\nv. Depicting or analyzing the options of the question is also relevant.\nvi. Repeating previous relevant steps are also considered relevant. \n\nThe following behaviour is considered as irrelevant: \ni. Depicting image information that does not related to what is asking in the question.  Example: The question asks how many cars are present in all the images. If the step focuses on other visual elements like the road or building, the step is considered as irrelevant.\nii. Self-thought not related to what the question is asking.\niii. Other information that is tangential for answering the question.\n\n\n# Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"A brief summary of step result\",\n    \"relevant\": \"Yes|No\"\n  }\n]\n\n\n# Output Rules\nDirect JSON output without any other output\nOutput at most 40 steps\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\n<image>The image displays an intelligence test question featuring a 3x3 grid with nine boxes, where the 9th box is marked with a question mark (?). Your task is to select the correct shape from eight options (labeled A to H) to fill the 9th box, completing the pattern that links all the shapes together.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this intelligence test question, we need to identify the pattern that links the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Observe the grid\nThe grid is divided into three rows and three columns. Each cell contains a shape, and the goal is to determine the missing shape in the bottom-right cell (the 9th box).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the patterns\n#### Row-wise analysis:\n- **Row 1**: The shapes are circles of decreasing size.\n  - First box: Large black circle.\n  - Second box: Medium gray circle.\n  - Third box: Small white circle.\n\n- **Row 2**: The shapes are hexagons of decreasing size.\n  - First box: Large black hexagon.\n  - Second box: Medium light gray hexagon.\n  - Third box: Small black hexagon.\n\n- **Row 3**: The shapes are squares of decreasing size.\n  - First box: Large light gray square.\n  - Second box: Medium light gray square.\n  - Third box: ? (We need to determine this.)\n\n#### Column-wise analysis:\n- **Column 1**: The shapes are large figures of different types (circle, hexagon, square).\n  - First box: Large black circle.\n  - Second box: Large black hexagon.\n  - Third box: Large light gray square.\n\n- **Column 2**: The shapes are medium-sized figures of different types (circle, hexagon, square).\n  - First box: Medium gray circle.\n  - Second box: Medium light gray hexagon.\n  - Third box: Medium light gray square.\n\n- **Column 3**: The shapes are small figures of different types (circle, hexagon, square).\n  - First box: Small white circle.\n  - Second box: Small black hexagon.\n  - Third box: ? (We need to determine this.)\n\n### Step 3: Identify the missing shape\nFrom the analysis:\n- The shapes in each row decrease in size.\n- The shapes in each column follow a sequence of different types (circle, hexagon, square).\n\nFor the third row (squares):\n- The first square is large.\n- The second square is medium.\n- The third square should be small.\n\nFor the third column (small shapes):\n- The first shape is a small white circle.\n- The second shape is a small black hexagon.\n- The third shape should be a small black square.\n\n### Step 4: Match the options\nThe correct shape must be a small black square. Among the given options:\n- **D** is a small black square.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}",
