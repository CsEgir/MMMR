(select from A-E)\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nSo I've got this pattern recognition problem here. There are six squares on top, each containing a circular shape with some design inside, and then there's a question mark in the last square. Below these, there are five options labeled A through E, and I need to choose which one should replace the question mark to follow the pattern above.\n\nFirst, I need to observe the pattern in the top row. Let's look at each square one by one:\n\n1. The first square has a circle with a cross through it, and inside the circle, there's a small circle.\n\n2. The second square shows a circle with four curved lines pointing outward, like petals of a flower.\n\n3. The third square has a circle with four lines sticking out, each line has a small circle at the end.\n\n4. The fourth square displays a circle with four curved lines pointing inward.\n\n5. The fifth square is similar to the first one, with a cross through the circle and a small circle inside.\n\n6. Then there's the question mark.\n\nHmm, it seems like there's some repetition or alternation going on here. Let's see:\n\nLooking at squares 1 and 5, they both have a cross through the circle and a small circle inside. Maybe every odd-numbered square follows this design?\n\nSquare 2 has the petal-like design, square 3 has lines with circles at the ends, square 4 has inward-pointing curves. It doesn't seem straightforward.\n\nWait, perhaps there's a pattern in the way the lines are arranged or the direction they're pointing.\n\nLet me try to categorize the designs:\n\n- Cross through the circle with a small circle inside (squares 1 and 5)\n\n- Petal-like outward curves (square 2)\n\n- Lines with circles at the ends (square 3)\n\n- Inward-pointing curves (square 4)\n\nIf I look at the sequence: cross, petals, lines with circles, inward curves, cross again, question mark.\n\nMaybe the pattern is alternating between certain designs every few squares.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the number of elements is increasing or following some sequence.\n\nLet's consider the number of elements in each design:\n\n- Square 1: one cross and one small circle\n\n- Square 2: four petal-like curves\n\n- Square 3: four lines with circles at the ends (so four lines and four circles)\n\n- Square 4: four inward curves\n\n- Square 5: same as square 1\n\n- Question mark: ?\n\nNot sure about the numbering pattern here.\n\nMaybe it's about the direction of the lines or curves.\n\nIn square 1 and 5, the cross goes through the circle, and there's a small circle inside.\n\nIn square 2, the curves are pointing outward from the circle.\n\nIn square 3, there are lines extending outward with circles at the ends.\n\nIn square 4, the curves are pointing inward towards the center.\n\nPerhaps the pattern alternates between outward and inward directions, or some other alternation.\n\nLooking at squares 1 and 5 being similar, maybe every third square repeats the same design.\n\nIf that's the case, then after square 5, which is same as square 1, the next should be square 2's design, then square 3, and so on.\n\nBut the sequence is 1,2,3,4,1,? which doesn't repeat every three squares.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's every two squares repeating a certain pattern.\n\nWait, squares 1 and 5 are identical, so perhaps every fourth square repeats a design.\n\nBut square 4 is different from square 1.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a cycle of four designs, and the fifth square starts the cycle again.\n\nIn that case, after squares 1 through 4, square 5 should be square 1 again, and then square 6 should be square 2, which is the question mark.\n\nBut that doesn't help because we need to find square 6.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's a progression where each square builds upon the previous one.\n\nLet's see:\n\n- Square 1: cross through circle with small circle inside\n\n- Square 2: outward curves (petals)\n\n- Square 3: lines with circles at ends\n\n- Square 4: inward curves\n\n- Square 5: back to cross through circle with small circle inside\n\n- Question mark: what comes next?\n\nPerhaps it's an alternation between squares with crosses and squares with curves.\n\nSquares 1 and 5 have crosses, while squares 2,3,4 have different types of curves.\n\nIf that's the case, then the question mark should be another curve-type design, since square 5 is a cross.\n\nBut wait, if squares 1 and 5 are crosses, then squares 2,3,4 are curves, and square 6 should be a curve as well.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's two crosses followed by three curves, and then repeat.\n\nBut that doesn't seem to fit.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is cross, curve, cross, curve, etc., but that doesn't match the given sequence.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's cross, curve, cross, curve, cross, curve, but square 5 is a cross again after square 1.\n\nWait, perhaps it's cross, curve, cross, curve, cross, curve, but square 5 is a cross again after square 1.\n\nBut that would make square 6 a curve.\n\nBut looking at the options A through E, all of them have crosses.\n\nWait, no:\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA: circle with four lines sticking out, each ending with a small circle\n\nB: circle with four curved lines pointing outward\n\nC: circle with four curved lines pointing inward\n\nD: circle with a cross through it and a small circle inside, similar to square 1 and 5\n\nE: circle with a cross through it and a small circle inside, similar to square 1 and 5\n\nWait, options D and E are similar to squares 1 and 5.\n\nOption A is similar to square 3.\n\nOption B is similar to square 2.\n\nOption C is similar to square 4.\n\nSo, if the sequence is D (square 1), B (square 2), A (square 3), C (square 4), D (square 5), then the question mark should be B again, following the sequence D,B,A,C,D,B,...\n\nBut that's just a guess.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's D,B,A,C,D,E,...\n\nBut E is similar to D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's D,B,A,C,D,B,...\n\nIn that case, after D, it should be B.\n\nBut looking at the options, B is option B.\n\nSo, perhaps the answer is B.\n\nBut let's check if there's another possible pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's every other square that has a cross.\n\nSquares 1,3,5 have crosses.\n\nWait, squares 1,3,5 have crosses? No, square 3 has lines with circles at the ends.\n\nWait, no, square 3 has lines with circles at the ends, while squares 1 and 5 have crosses.\n\nSo, perhaps squares 1 and 5 are crosses, and the others are curves.\n\nIf that's the case, then the question mark should be a curve.\n\nBut looking at the options, only option B is a curve.\n\nOptions A, D, E have crosses, and C has inward curves.\n\nSo, if the pattern is crosses in squares 1 and 5, and curves in squares 2,3,4, then the question mark should be a curve, which is option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is crosses in odd-numbered squares and curves in even-numbered squares.\n\nSquares 1,3,5 are crosses (though square 3 is not a cross), and squares 2,4 are curves.\n\nWait, square 3 is not a cross; it's lines with circles at the ends.\n\nSo, that theory doesn't hold.\n\nAlternatively, maybe it's crosses in squares 1 and 5, and curves in squares 2,4, and perhaps 6.\n\nBut that doesn't explain square 3.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps square 3 is a transition between curves and crosses.\n\nBut that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is based on the number of elements or the direction of the lines.\n\nFor example, squares 1 and 5 have a cross and a small circle inside, squares 2 and 4 have outward and inward curves, and square 3 has lines with circles at the ends.\n\nPerhaps the pattern is alternating between outward and inward directions, with square 3 being a combination.\n\nBut that doesn't seem consistent.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is cross, outward curves, lines with circles, inward curves, cross again, and then outward curves again.\n\nIn that case, the question mark would be outward curves, which is option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is cross, outward curves, lines with circles, inward curves, cross again, and then lines with circles again.\n\nBut that doesn't match the initial pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is cross, outward curves, lines with circles, inward curves, cross again, and then outward curves again.\n\nIn that case, the answer would be option B.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is cross, outward curves, lines with circles, inward curves, cross again, and then lines with circles again.\n\nBut that would make the answer option A.\n\nBut option A has lines with circles at the ends, similar to square 3.\n\nHowever, square 3 is already present, and the sequence is cross, outward curves, lines with circles, inward curves, cross again, so the next should be outward curves again.\n\nWhich is option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is cross, outward curves, lines with circles, inward curves, cross again, and then outward curves again.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nSo, the answer should be option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is cross, outward curves, lines with circles, inward curves, cross again, and then inward curves again.\n\nBut that would make the answer option C, which is inward curves.\n\nBut square 4 already has inward curves, and square 5 is a cross again.\n\nSo, having another inward curves would repeat square 4, which might not be the intended pattern.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is cross, outward curves, lines with circles, inward curves, cross again, and then outward curves again.\n\nThat seems more likely.\n\nSo, the answer should be option B.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is cross, outward curves, lines with circles, inward curves, cross again, and then lines with circles again.\n\nBut that would make the answer option A.\n\nHowever, that would repeat square 3, which might not be the case.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is cross, outward curves, lines with circles, inward curves, cross again, and then outward curves again.\n\nYes, that seems consistent.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1.
