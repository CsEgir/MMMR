There's a central figure with a coordinate system, and four options labeled A, B, C, and D. Each option shows a different arrangement of symbols around the coordinate axes. The question is asking which of these figures is a rotation of the original object.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's in the central figure. There's a coordinate system with horizontal and vertical axes, each having arrows indicating direction. Plotted on this system are three symbols: a solid circle, a plus sign, and an empty circle, each placed at different positions relative to the axes.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Shows a coordinate system with the same symbols but arranged differently compared to the central figure.\n\nB. Also has the symbols placed differently, with the axes arrows pointing in opposite directions.\n\nC. Displays another arrangement of the symbols with the axes arrows pointing downwards.\n\nD. Presents yet another configuration with the symbols and axes arrows.\n\nMy task is to determine which of these arrangements can be obtained by rotating the original central figure.\n\nI should recall that rotation in a coordinate system involves turning the figure around a central point, typically the origin where the axes cross. Rotations can be clockwise or counterclockwise, and common rotation angles are 90\u00b0, 180\u00b0, or 270\u00b0.\n\nTo solve this, I need to visualize or sketch the rotation of the central figure by these angles and see which option matches one of these rotated positions.\n\nLet me consider rotating the central figure by 90\u00b0 clockwise. That would mean that each point's coordinates would change accordingly. For example, a point originally at (x, y) would move to (y, -x) after a 90\u00b0 clockwise rotation.\n\nAlternatively, a 180\u00b0 rotation would place a point at (-x, -y), and a 270\u00b0 clockwise rotation would place it at (-y, x).\n\nI should apply these transformations to each of the symbols in the central figure and see which option matches.\n\nBut before diving into that, perhaps I should look at the positions of the symbols relative to the axes in the central figure.\n\nIn the central figure:\n\n- The solid circle is positioned in the top-left quadrant.\n\n- The plus sign is in the top-right quadrant.\n\n- The empty circle is in the bottom-right quadrant.\n\n- There's an 'x' in the bottom-left quadrant.\n\nWait, actually, looking closer, there are four symbols in the central figure: a solid circle, a plus sign, an empty circle, and an 'x'.\n\n- Solid circle: top-left quadrant.\n\n- Plus sign: top-right quadrant.\n\n- 'x': bottom-left quadrant.\n\n- Empty circle: bottom-right quadrant.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA.\n\n- Solid circle: top-left quadrant.\n\n- Plus sign: top-right quadrant.\n\n- 'x': bottom-left quadrant.\n\n- Empty circle: bottom-right quadrant.\n\nThis looks identical to the central figure, but perhaps it's a rotation of 0\u00b0, meaning no rotation.\n\nB.\n\n- Solid circle: top-right quadrant.\n\n- Plus sign: bottom-right quadrant.\n\n- 'x': top-left quadrant.\n\n- Empty circle: bottom-left quadrant.\n\nThis seems like a reflection, not a rotation.\n\nC.\n\n- Solid circle: top-right quadrant.\n\n- Plus sign: bottom-left quadrant.\n\n- 'x': top-left quadrant.\n\n- Empty circle: bottom-right quadrant.\n\nAgain, this doesn't match a simple rotation.\n\nD.\n\n- Solid circle: top-left quadrant.\n\n- Plus sign: bottom-right quadrant.\n\n- 'x': top-right quadrant.\n\n- Empty circle: bottom-left quadrant.\n\nThis also doesn't seem to match a rotation.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the direction of the axes arrows as well. In the central figure, the horizontal axis points to the right, and the vertical axis points upwards. In option A, the axes arrows are similar: horizontal to the right and vertical upwards. In option B, the horizontal arrow points to the left, and the vertical arrow points upwards. In option C, the horizontal arrow points to the right, but the vertical arrow points downwards. In option D, the horizontal arrow points to the right, and the vertical arrow points downwards.\n\nIf I rotate the central figure by 180\u00b0, the horizontal axis would point to the left, and the vertical axis would point downwards. That matches option C's vertical arrow but not the horizontal arrow.\n\nAlternatively, rotating by 90\u00b0 clockwise would make the horizontal axis point upwards, and the vertical axis point to the right, which doesn't match any option.\n\nRotating by 90\u00b0 counterclockwise would make the horizontal axis point downwards, and the vertical axis point to the left, which also doesn't match any option.\n\nPerhaps I need to consider that the axes themselves are being rotated, and I need to account for that.\n\nLet me try to visualize rotating the entire figure, including the axes.\n\nIf I rotate the central figure by 180\u00b0, the symbols would swap positions across the origin.\n\nSo, original positions:\n\n- Solid circle: top-left.\n\n- Plus sign: top-right.\n\n- 'x': bottom-left.\n\n- Empty circle: bottom-right.\n\nAfter 180\u00b0 rotation:\n\n- Solid circle would move to bottom-right.\n\n- Plus sign to bottom-left.\n\n- 'x' to top-right.\n\n- Empty circle to top-left.\n\nLooking at option D, it shows:\n\n- Solid circle: top-left.\n\n- Plus sign: bottom-right.\n\n- 'x': top-right.\n\n- Empty circle: bottom-left.\n\nThis matches the positions after a 180\u00b0 rotation.\n\nAdditionally, the axes in option D have the horizontal arrow pointing to the right and the vertical arrow pointing downwards, which is consistent with a 180\u00b0 rotation of the original axes.\n\nTherefore, option D is a rotation of the original object.\n\nTo confirm, let's consider the positions:\n\n- Original:\n\n- Horizontal axis: rightward.\n\n- Vertical axis: upward.\n\n- After 180\u00b0 rotation:\n\n- Horizontal axis: leftward (opposite of original).\n\n- Vertical axis: downward (opposite of original).\n\nIn option D, the axes are drawn with the horizontal arrow to the right and vertical arrow downward. This seems contradictory at first, but perhaps the axes are being mirrored or something.\n\nWait, if I rotate the entire figure by 180\u00b0, the axes should reverse direction. So, horizontal axis originally to the right becomes to the left after 180\u00b0 rotation, and vertical axis originally upward becomes downward after 180\u00b0 rotation.\n\nBut in option D, the horizontal arrow is to the right, not to the left. So, there's inconsistency here.\n\nMaybe I need to consider that the axes are fixed, and only the symbols are being rotated.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the figure is being rotated within the coordinate system, but the coordinate system itself remains fixed.\n\nIf that's the case, then rotating the symbols by 180\u00b0 would place them in opposite quadrants, as I described earlier.\n\nIn that scenario, option D shows the symbols in the positions they would be after a 180\u00b0 rotation, assuming the coordinate system is fixed.\n\nHowever, the axes arrows in option D show horizontal to the right and vertical downward, which suggests that the coordinate system itself might have been rotated or reflected.\n\nThis is getting confusing. Maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAnother approach: perhaps the figure is being rotated as a whole, including the coordinate system.\n\nIf I rotate the entire figure, including the coordinate system, by 180\u00b0, then both the symbols and the axes should reflect that rotation.\n\nIn that case, the symbols would move to opposite quadrants, and the axes would reverse direction.\n\nSo, original axes: horizontal to the right, vertical upward.\n\nAfter 180\u00b0 rotation: horizontal to the left, vertical downward.\n\nBut in option D, the horizontal arrow is to the right, which doesn't match the expected leftward direction after a 180\u00b0 rotation.\n\nThis suggests that option D is not correctly representing the rotation of the coordinate system.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the coordinate system is fixed, and only the symbols are being rotated.\n\nIn that case, rotating the symbols by 180\u00b0 would place them in opposite quadrants, which matches option D's configuration.\n\nMoreover, since the coordinate system is fixed, the axes arrows remain horizontal to the right and vertical upward, which aligns with option D.\n\nWait, but in option D, the vertical arrow is downward, which contradicts this assumption.\n\nThis is perplexing.\n\nPerhaps the correct interpretation is that the symbols are being rotated within a fixed coordinate system, and option D shows the symbols after rotation, but the coordinate system itself is unchanged.\n\nIn that case, option D would be correct for the symbols' positions after a 180\u00b0 rotation, despite the axes arrows being incorrectly shown.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the entire figure, including the coordinate system, is being rotated, and option D is attempting to depict that.\n\nGiven that, option D seems to be the closest match to a 180\u00b0 rotation of the entire figure, including the coordinate system.\n\nTherefore, the answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1.
