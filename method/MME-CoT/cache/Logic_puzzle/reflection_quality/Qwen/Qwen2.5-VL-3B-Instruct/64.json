    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nYou are given a puzzle. The puzzle consists of a question part on the top and the choices part in the bottom. The question part on the top is a set of visual panels arranged in a 2 by 3 matrix, with the bottom right piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the pattern or rule that governs the arrangement of the visual panels. Let's examine the given matrix:\n\n```\n 1   2   3\n4   5   6\n```\n\nThe bottom right piece is missing, and we need to determine which choice (1, 2, 3, or 4) fits best in its place.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n1. **Identify Patterns:**\n   - The top row has three shapes: a circle, a half-circle, and a full circle.\n   - The middle row has two shapes: a zigzag line and a straight line.\n   - The bottom row is missing a shape.\n\n2. **Pattern Recognition:**\n   - The top row seems to alternate between circles and half-circles.\n   - The middle row alternates between zigzags and straight lines.\n   - The bottom row should follow the same alternating pattern as the other rows.\n\n3. **Determine Missing Shape:**\n   - Since the bottom row currently has a zigzag line (shape 4), the next shape should be a straight line (shape 3).\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part is **choice 3**.\n\n\\boxed{3}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
