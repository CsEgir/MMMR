    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nWhich option from A-E should replace the question mark to follow the pattern present above the separating line? (select from A-E)\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine the correct answer, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence of shapes above the separating line. Let's analyze the sequence:\n\n1. The first shape is a solid circle.\n2. The second shape is a hollow circle.\n3. The third shape is a hollow circle with a diagonal line through it.\n4. The fourth shape is a hollow circle with a diagonal line through it and a small dot inside.\n\nThe pattern seems to be alternating between solid and hollow circles, with each subsequent shape having an additional element (a diagonal line or a small dot) added to the hollow circle.\n\nFollowing this pattern:\n- The fifth shape should be a solid circle.\n- The sixth shape should be a hollow circle with a diagonal line through it.\n\nLooking at the options provided:\nA: A solid circle\nB: A hollow circle with a diagonal line through it\nC: A hollow circle with a diagonal line through it and a small dot inside\nD: A hollow circle with a diagonal line through it\nE: A hollow circle\n\nBased on the pattern, the correct option to replace the question mark is:\n\n\\boxed{A}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
