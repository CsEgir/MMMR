    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\n<image>The image displays an intelligence test question featuring a 3x3 grid with nine boxes, where the 9th box is marked with a question mark (?). Your task is to select the correct shape from eight options (labeled A to H) to fill the 9th box, completing the pattern that links all the shapes together.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern that links all the shapes together in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the given shapes:\n\n1. The first row shows a circle with three black dots.\n2. The second row shows a pentagon with five white dots.\n3. The third row shows a hexagon with two black dots.\n\nLooking at these patterns, we can see that each shape is composed of dots arranged in a specific order:\n- The first shape has one dot in the center.\n- The second shape has five dots arranged in a circular pattern.\n- The third shape has two dots in a linear arrangement.\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next shape should have four dots arranged in a square pattern (since it's the fourth shape in the sequence).\n\nNow, let's look at the options provided:\nA. Two dots in a vertical line\nB. Three dots in a triangular pattern\nC. Four dots in a square pattern\nD. Five dots in a circular pattern\nE. Six dots in a hexagonal pattern\nF. Seven dots in an octagonal pattern\nG. Eight dots in a star-like pattern\nH. Nine dots in a cross-like pattern\n\nThe correct answer that fits the pattern of having four dots in a square arrangement is option C.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{C}.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1.
