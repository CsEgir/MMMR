    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\n<image>The image displays an intelligence test question in the form of a matrix pattern puzzle. There are eight shapes provided, with one space left blank, indicated by a question mark. The shapes are organized into three rows, each containing three boxes. Your task is to select the correct shape from six options (labeled A to F) to fill the empty box, completing the pattern that links all the shapes together.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that links all the shapes together. Let's analyze each row and column:\n\n1. **First Row:**\n   - Top left: Triangle with a dot\n   - Top middle: Diamond with a star\n   - Top right: Triangle with a star\n\n2. **Second Row:**\n   - Middle left: Circle with a triangle\n   - Middle middle: Circle with a square\n   - Middle right: Circle with a circle\n\n3. **Third Row:**\n   - Bottom left: Triangle with a star\n   - Bottom middle: Triangle with a circle\n   - Bottom right: Question mark (we need to find the correct shape)\n\nNow, let's look at the options provided for the bottom right box:\n\n- A: Triangle with a dot\n- B: Triangle with a star\n- C: Triangle with a square\n- D: Triangle with a circle\n- E: Triangle with a triangle\n- F: Triangle with a diamond\n\nBy comparing these options with the pattern in the third row:\n- The top right shape is a triangle with a star.\n- The middle right shape is a triangle with a circle.\n\nFollowing this pattern, the bottom right shape should be a triangle with a star.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is **B**.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
