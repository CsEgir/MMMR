    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nYou are given a puzzle. The puzzle consists of a question part on the top and the choices part in the bottom. The question part on the top is a set of visual panels arranged in a 1 by 5 sequence, with the last piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern or rule that governs the sequence of visual panels. Let's analyze the given sequence:\n\n1. The first panel is a diagonal line.\n2. The second panel is a horizontal line with a diagonal line at the top.\n3. The third panel is a diagonal line with a small square at the bottom.\n4. The fourth panel is a vertical line with a diagonal line at the top.\n\nNow, let's look at the choices provided:\n\n1. A downward arrow\n2. A horizontal line with a small square at the bottom\n3. An upward arrow\n4. A vertical line\n\nWe need to find which choice fits the pattern observed in the sequence. Observing the sequence, we notice that each panel alternates between having a diagonal line and a vertical line. Additionally, the placement of the small square changes from the bottom of the third panel to the top of the fourth panel.\n\nGiven these observations, the missing panel should have a diagonal line and be placed at the top (since the last panel has a diagonal line at the top). Among the choices, only choice 1 (a downward arrow) fits this description.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part is \\boxed{1}.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
