    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nAmong the following options, the one that conforms to the change rule of the given graph is: ().\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine which option conforms to the change rule of the given graph, we need to analyze the sequence and identify the pattern. Let's examine the sequence step by step:\n\n1. The first symbol is a circle with a line through it.\n2. The second symbol is an arrow pointing upwards.\n3. The third symbol is a square with a diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right.\n4. The fourth symbol is a lightning bolt.\n\nNow, let's look at the options provided:\n\nA: A circle with a line through it\nB: An arrow pointing upwards\nC: A square with a diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right\nD: A lightning bolt\n\nWe can see that the symbols in the sequence are:\n- Circle with a line through it (first symbol)\n- Arrow pointing upwards (second symbol)\n- Square with a diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right (third symbol)\n- Lightning bolt (fourth symbol)\n\nThe pattern seems to be that each symbol is a different geometric shape or figure. Therefore, the next symbol should be a different geometric shape or figure from the ones already in the sequence.\n\nLooking at the options, none of them match the fourth symbol (lightning bolt). However, if we consider the possibility that the pattern might involve a different type of shape or figure, we can infer that the next symbol could be a different geometric shape or figure.\n\nGiven the options, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{D}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
