    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nYou are given a puzzle. The puzzle consists of a question part on the top and the choices in the bottom. The question part on the top is a set of visual grids arranged in a 3 by 3 matrix, with the bottom right piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the pattern or rule that governs the arrangement of the symbols in the 3x3 matrix. Let's examine the given grid:\n\n```\n4 | . | O\n---+---+---\n. | ✓ | 6\n---+---+---\nQ | . | .\n```\n\nThe missing piece is located at the bottom right corner of the grid. We need to determine which symbol (D, W, Y, G) fits best in this position based on the pattern observed in the other parts of the grid.\n\n1. **Horizontal Pattern:**\n   - The first row has the symbols 4, _, O.\n   - The second row has the symbols _, ✓, 6.\n   - The third row has the symbols Q, _, _.\n\n2. **Vertical Pattern:**\n   - The left column has the symbols 4, _, Q.\n   - The middle column has the symbols _, ✓, _.\n   - The right column has the symbols _, 6, _.\n\nFrom the horizontal and vertical patterns, we can infer that each row and column should contain a unique symbol from the set {4, ✓, 6, Q}.\n\nGiven the choices:\n- D\n- W\n- Y\n- G\n\nWe need to find a symbol that does not appear in any of the rows or columns already filled. \n\nLet's check each choice:\n- D appears in the first row.\n- W does not appear in any row or column.\n- Y appears in the third row.\n- G appears in the third column.\n\nSince W does not appear in any row or column, it is the most appropriate choice to fill the missing part.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{W}.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
    "valid_outputs": "```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"The reflection step identified is 'But W', which suggests reconsidering the previous conclusion.\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"Wrong Conclusion\"\n  }\n]\n```",
