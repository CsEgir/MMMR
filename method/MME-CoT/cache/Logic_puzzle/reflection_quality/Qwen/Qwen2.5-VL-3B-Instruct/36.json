    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nYou are given a puzzle. The puzzle consists of a question part on the top and the choices in the bottom. The question part on the top is a set of visual grids arranged in a 3 by 3 matrix, with the bottom right piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the pattern or rule that governs the arrangement of letters in the 3x3 matrix. Let's examine the given grid:\n\n```\nA T M\nJ G L\nB D _\n```\n\nThe missing piece is in the bottom right corner. We need to determine which letter from the choices (N, C, F, Z) fits best in this position.\n\nFirst, let's look at the horizontal and vertical patterns:\n- The first row has A, T, M.\n- The second row has J, G, L.\n- The third row currently has B, D, _.\n\nWe can see that each row and column seems to follow a specific pattern. Let's try to identify it by looking at the letters in the rows and columns:\n\n1. First row: A, T, M\n2. Second row: J, G, L\n3. Third row: B, D, ?\n\nLooking at the choices (N, C, F, Z), we need to find a letter that fits into the blank space while maintaining the pattern. \n\nLet's consider the possible placements:\n- If we place N in the third row, it doesn't fit well with the existing letters.\n- If we place C in the third row, it also doesn't fit well.\n- If we place F in the third row, it doesn't fit well either.\n- If we place Z in the third row, it fits well as it completes the pattern.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part is Z.\n\n\\boxed{Z}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
