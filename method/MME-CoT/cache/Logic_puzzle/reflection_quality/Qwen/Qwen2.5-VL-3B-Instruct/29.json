    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nThe most appropriate way to fill in the question mark is ().\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine the most appropriate way to fill in the question mark, we need to analyze the pattern or rule that governs the sequence of shapes.\n\nLet's examine the given shapes:\n\n1. The first shape is a square with 4 dots.\n2. The second shape is a rectangle with 6 dots.\n3. The third shape is a square with 8 dots.\n4. The fourth shape is a rectangle with 10 dots.\n\nWe can observe that each shape increases by 2 dots from the previous one:\n- From the first shape (4 dots) to the second shape (6 dots), there is an increase of 2 dots.\n- From the second shape (6 dots) to the third shape (8 dots), there is another increase of 2 dots.\n- From the third shape (8 dots) to the fourth shape (10 dots), there is yet another increase of 2 dots.\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next shape should have 12 dots (since 10 + 2 = 12).\n\nNow, let's look at the options provided:\nA. A shape with 12 dots\nB. A shape with 14 dots\nC. A shape with 16 dots\nD. A shape with 18 dots\n\nSince the pattern shows an increase of 2 dots each time, and the last shape has 10 dots, the next shape should have 12 dots.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{A}.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
