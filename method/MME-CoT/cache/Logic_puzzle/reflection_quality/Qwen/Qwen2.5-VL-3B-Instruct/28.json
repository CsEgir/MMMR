    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nGiven the plan development of the outer surface of the carton on the left, which item on the right can be folded?（  ）\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine which item on the right can be folded from the given plan of the outer surface of the carton, we need to visualize how each option would look when unfolded.\n\n1. **Option A**: This option shows a cube with one face missing. When unfolded, it should have six faces forming a cube shape.\n2. **Option B**: This option shows a cube with two faces missing. When unfolded, it should have five faces forming a cube shape.\n3. **Option C**: This option shows a cube with three faces missing. When unfolded, it should have four faces forming a cube shape.\n4. **Option D**: This option shows a cube with four faces missing. When unfolded, it should have three faces forming a cube shape.\n\nGiven the plan of the outer surface of the carton, we need to match this pattern with one of these options. The plan has a specific arrangement of squares that must be consistent with the folding process.\n\nBy examining the plan and comparing it to the options, we can see that Option A matches the pattern most closely. It has six faces forming a cube shape, which is consistent with the plan's outer surface.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{A}.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
