    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nFrom the following four figures, find one figure with different patterns from the other three ().\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine which figure has a different pattern from the other three, we need to analyze the patterns in each figure:\n\n1. **Figure A**: The pattern consists of two shapes (a circle and a triangle) with arrows pointing in opposite directions.\n2. **Figure B**: The pattern consists of two shapes (a circle and a triangle) with arrows pointing in the same direction.\n3. **Figure C**: The pattern consists of two shapes (a circle and a triangle) with arrows pointing in opposite directions.\n4. **Figure D**: The pattern consists of two shapes (a circle and a triangle) with arrows pointing in the same direction.\n\nComparing the patterns:\n- Figures A and C have arrows pointing in opposite directions.\n- Figures B and D have arrows pointing in the same direction.\n\nTherefore, the figures with different patterns are A and C, or B and D. Since the question asks for one figure with a different pattern from the others, we can choose either A or C.\n\n\\boxed{A}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
