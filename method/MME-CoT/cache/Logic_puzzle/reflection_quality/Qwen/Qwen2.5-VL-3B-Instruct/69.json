    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nFrom the four options given, choose the most suitable one and fill in the question mark to make it show a certain regularity.（）\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence of shapes. Let's analyze each shape step by step:\n\n1. **First Shape**: The top-left corner is black, and the rest are white.\n2. **Second Shape**: The top-left corner is black, and the rest are white.\n3. **Third Shape**: The top-left corner is black, and the rest are white.\n4. **Fourth Shape**: The top-left corner is black, and the rest are white.\n\nFrom these observations, it appears that the pattern involves a consistent arrangement where the top-left corner is always black and the rest of the squares are white. \n\nNow, let's look at the options provided:\n\n- **A**: This option has a black square in the center, which does not match the pattern where the top-left corner is black.\n- **B**: This option has a black square in the bottom-right corner, which also does not match the pattern.\n- **C**: This option has a black square in the bottom-left corner, which does not match the pattern.\n- **D**: This option has a black square in the top-left corner, which matches the pattern.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{D}.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
