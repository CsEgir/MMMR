    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\n<image>The image displays an intelligence test question in the form of a matrix pattern puzzle. There are eight shapes provided, with one space left blank, indicated by a question mark. The shapes are organized into three rows, each containing three boxes. Your task is to select the correct shape from six options (labeled A to F) to fill the empty box, completing the pattern that links all the shapes together.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this matrix pattern puzzle, we need to identify the logical sequence or rule that connects all the shapes in the rows. Let's analyze each row:\n\n1. The first row has shapes: \\(\\bullet\\), \\(\\text{V}\\), and \\(\\text{T}\\).\n2. The second row has shapes: \\(\\text{V}\\), \\(\\text{T}\\), and \\(\\text{X}\\).\n3. The third row has shapes: \\(\\text{X}\\), \\(\\text{T}\\), and \\(\\text{V}\\).\n\nWe observe that the shapes in each row are arranged in a specific order:\n- First row: \\(\\bullet\\), \\(\\text{V}\\), \\(\\text{T}\\)\n- Second row: \\(\\text{V}\\), \\(\\text{T}\\), \\(\\text{X}\\)\n- Third row: \\(\\text{X}\\), \\(\\text{T}\\), \\(\\text{V}\\)\n\nThe pattern seems to be alternating between two types of shapes: one type appears in the first and third positions, and the other type appears in the second position.\n\nLooking at the options provided (A to F):\n- A: \\(\\text{V}\\) (appears in the second position)\n- B: \\(\\text{T}\\) (appears in the second position)\n- C: \\(\\text{X}\\) (appears in the third position)\n- D: \\(\\text{V}\\) (appears in the second position)\n- E: \\(\\text{T}\\) (appears in the second position)\n- F: \\(\\text{X}\\) (appears in the third position)\n\nBased on the observed pattern, the correct shape to fill the blank is the one that appears in the third position of the rows. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{C}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1.
