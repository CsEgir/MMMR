    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nFrom the given options, select the most suitable one and fill in the question mark to make it show a certain regularity ().\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or relationship between the words in the given grid. Let's analyze each row and column:\n\n1. **First Row: 上 共 种**\n   - \"上\" (top) is related to \"共\" (together).\n   - \"种\" (plant) is related to \"土\" (soil).\n\n2. **Second Row: 土 朴 ？**\n   - \"土\" (soil) is related to \"朴\" (simple).\n   - The question mark needs to be filled with a word that logically follows \"朴\".\n\n3. **Third Row: 干 说 房 阶**\n   - \"干\" (dry) is related to \"说\" (say).\n   - \"房\" (house) is related to \"阶\" (step).\n\nNow, let's look at the second row again:\n- \"土\" (soil) is related to \"朴\" (simple).\n- We need to find a word that fits the pattern of being related to \"朴\" (simple).\n\nThe word \"朴\" (simple) could be related to \"房\" (house), as both are nouns describing something simple or basic.\n\nTherefore, the most suitable word to fill in the question mark is \"房\".\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{房}.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
    "valid_outputs": "```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"The word '房' (house) fits the pattern of being related to '朴' (simple).\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A\"\n  }\n]\n```",
