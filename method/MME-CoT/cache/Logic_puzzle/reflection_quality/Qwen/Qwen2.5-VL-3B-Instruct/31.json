    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nYou are given a puzzle. The puzzle consists of a question part on the top and the choices in the bottom. The question part on the top is a set of visual grids arranged in a 3 by 3 matrix, with the bottom right piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the pattern or rule that governs the arrangement of the shapes in the 3x3 matrix. Let's examine the given context and choices step by step.\n\n### Context Analysis:\n1. **Top Row:**\n   - First column: A downward arrow.\n   - Second column: A crescent moon.\n   - Third column: A zigzag line.\n\n2. **Middle Row:**\n   - First column: A slash.\n   - Second column: A double crescent moon.\n   - Third column: A zigzag line.\n\n3. **Bottom Row:**\n   - First column: A cross with a dot.\n   - Second column: A double crescent moon.\n\n### Choices:\n1. A star-like shape.\n2. A diamond-shaped shape.\n3. A square-like shape.\n4. A zigzag line.\n\n### Pattern Recognition:\n- The first column consistently has a downward arrow.\n- The second column consistently has a crescent moon.\n- The third column consistently has a zigzag line.\n- The middle row follows the same pattern as the top row.\n- The bottom row also follows the same pattern as the top row.\n\nGiven these observations, the missing piece in the bottom right corner should be a zigzag line, which matches the pattern observed in the other columns.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most appropriate answer to fill the missing part is choice **4** (a zigzag line).\n\n\\boxed{4}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
