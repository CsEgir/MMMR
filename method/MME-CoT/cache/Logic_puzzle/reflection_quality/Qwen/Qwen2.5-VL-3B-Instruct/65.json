    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\n<image>The image displays an intelligence test question in the form of a matrix pattern puzzle. There are eight shapes provided, with one space left blank, indicated by a question mark. The shapes are organized into three rows, each containing three boxes. Your task is to select the correct shape from six options (labeled A to F) to fill the empty box, completing the pattern that links all the shapes together.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that links all the shapes together. Let's analyze the given matrix:\n\n1. The top row has shapes: [A], [B], [C].\n2. The middle row has shapes: [D], [E], [F].\n3. The bottom row has shapes: [G], [H], [I].\n\nThe pattern seems to be a combination of horizontal and vertical shifts. Each shape in the first row is shifted one position to the right compared to the corresponding shape in the second row.\n\nLet's apply this pattern to the blank space in the matrix:\n\n- The top-left shape (A) should be shifted one position to the right.\n- The top-middle shape (B) should be shifted one position to the right.\n- The top-right shape (C) should be shifted one position to the right.\n\nFollowing this pattern:\n- The shape that should fill the blank space in the top row is the one that is two positions to the right of A, which is D.\n- The shape that should fill the blank space in the middle row is the one that is two positions to the right of B, which is E.\n- The shape that should fill the blank space in the bottom row is the one that is two positions to the right of C, which is F.\n\nTherefore, the correct shape to fill the blank space is **F**.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
