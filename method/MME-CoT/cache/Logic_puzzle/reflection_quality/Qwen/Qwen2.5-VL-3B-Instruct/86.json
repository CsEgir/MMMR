    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nWhich figure is a rotation of the object?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine which figure is a rotation of the given object, we need to analyze the orientation and position of the shapes in each option relative to the original figure.\n\nThe original figure has:\n- A circle at the top left.\n- A cross (plus sign) at the top right.\n- A circle at the bottom right.\n- An arrow pointing to the left at the bottom left.\n\nLet's examine each option:\n\nA. The circle is at the top right, the cross is at the bottom left, and the arrow is pointing to the right. This does not match the original figure.\n\nB. The circle is at the top right, the cross is at the bottom left, and the arrow is pointing to the left. This matches the original figure.\n\nC. The circle is at the bottom left, the cross is at the top right, and the arrow is pointing down. This does not match the original figure.\n\nD. The circle is at the bottom left, the cross is at the top right, and the arrow is pointing up. This does not match the original figure.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is B.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
    "valid_outputs": "```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"The reflection step identified is 'Alternatively, B'\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A\"\n  }\n]\n```",
