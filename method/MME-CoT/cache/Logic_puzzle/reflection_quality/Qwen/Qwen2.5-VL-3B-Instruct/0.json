    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nThis template is folded into:\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine the correct unfolded shape from the given folded template, we need to visualize how the shapes would look when unfolded. The template is a 3D object that has been folded into a specific configuration.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA: This shape appears to have one face with a circle in the center and four triangles around it. When unfolded, this could be part of a cube or another polyhedron where such a pattern might appear.\n\nB: This shape shows two circles on opposite sides and four triangles connecting them. When unfolded, this could also represent a section of a cube or another polyhedron.\n\nC: This shape has three circles in a triangular arrangement and four triangles connecting them. When unfolded, this could be part of a tetrahedron or another polyhedron where such a pattern might appear.\n\nD: This shape has two circles in a diagonal line and four triangles connecting them. When unfolded, this could be part of a cube or another polyhedron where such a pattern might appear.\n\nGiven the complexity of the problem, without additional context or a clearer description of the folding process, it's challenging to definitively match the exact unfolded shape. However, based on the patterns visible in the options, the most likely answer would be one that fits the general structure of the folded template.\n\nIf we assume the template is a cube (which is a common assumption for such problems), then the unfolded shape should resemble a cube with the given patterns.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\boxed{D}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
