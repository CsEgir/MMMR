    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nObjects exist without projection from the Self.  Select from A, B and C. (A) True (B)False (C)Insufficient Information\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine the correct answer, let's analyze the given text and statements:\n\n1. \"Objects exist without projection from the Self.\"\n2. \"All mirrors reflect the Self.\"\n3. \"Objects exist as Things-in-themselves.\"\n4. \"The Self projects onto Objects.\"\n5. \"The mirror is an Object.\"\n6. \"Only Things-in-themselves exist without a projection from the self.\"\n\nFrom these statements, we can deduce that:\n- The Self projects onto Objects.\n- Mirrors reflect the Self.\n- Objects are not projections of the Self but rather Things-in-themselves.\n\nGiven this information, the statement \"Objects exist without projection from the Self\" aligns with the concept that objects exist independently of the Self, which is a key point in the provided text.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{A}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
