    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nBased on the diagram at the top of the page, which two of the proposals A, B, C or D completes the diagrams at the bottom of the page?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this problem, we need to understand the pattern or rule that is being applied in the given diagram. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify the operations and their effects:**\n   - The first operation is a square with a circle inside it.\n   - The second operation is multiplication (Ã—).\n   - The third operation is a diamond shape.\n\n2. **Apply the operations to the bottom diagrams:**\n\n   **First Diagram:**\n   - We start with a circle.\n   - Apply the multiplication operation: \\( \\times \\)\n   - The result should be a rectangle because multiplying a circle by a number results in a rectangle.\n\n3. **Second Diagram:**\n   - We start with a circle.\n   - Apply the diamond shape operation: \\( \\diamond \\)\n   - The result should be a half-circle because the diamond shape typically represents division or halving an object.\n\nNow, let's match these results with the provided options:\n\n- For the first diagram, the correct option is D (half-circle).\n- For the second diagram, the correct option is A (circle).\n\nTherefore, the final answer is:\n\\boxed{A, D}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
