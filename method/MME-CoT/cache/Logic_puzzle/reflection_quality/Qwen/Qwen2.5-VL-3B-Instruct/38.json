    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nFrom the four options given, choose the most suitable one and fill in the question mark to make it show a certain regularity:\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence of shapes. Let's analyze each row and column to find a consistent rule.\n\n### Row Analysis\n1. **First Row:**\n   - Top-left: Black square on top, white square below.\n   - Top-right: White square on top, black square below.\n   - Bottom-left: Black square on top, white square below.\n   - Bottom-right: White square on top, black square below.\n\n2. **Second Row:**\n   - Top-left: Black square on top, white square below.\n   - Top-right: White square on top, black square below.\n   - Bottom-left: Black square on top, white square below.\n   - Bottom-right: White square on top, black square below.\n\n3. **Third Row:**\n   - Top-left: Black square on top, white square below.\n   - Top-right: White square on top, black square below.\n   - Bottom-left: Black square on top, white square below.\n   - Bottom-right: White square on top, black square below.\n\n### Column Analysis\n- **Column 1 (Top):**\n  - Top-left: Black square.\n  - Top-right: White square.\n  - Bottom-left: Black square.\n  - Bottom-right: White square.\n\n- **Column 2 (Middle):**\n  - Top-left: White square.\n  - Top-right: Black square.\n  - Bottom-left: White square.\n  - Bottom-right: Black square.\n\n- **Column 3 (Bottom):**\n  - Top-left: White square.\n  - Top-right: Black square.\n  - Bottom-left: White square.\n  - Bottom-right: Black square.\n\n### Identifying the Pattern\nFrom the analysis, it appears that:\n- The top-left and bottom-left squares alternate between black and white.\n- The top-right and bottom-right squares also alternate between black and white.\n\nGiven these observations, the shape in the question mark should have:\n- A black square on the top-left.\n- A white square on the top-right.\n- A white square on the bottom-left.\n- A black square on the bottom-right.\n\n### Matching with Options\nLooking at the options provided:\n- **A:** Black square on top, white square below.\n- **B:** Black square on top, white square below.\n- **C:** Black square on top, white square below.\n- **D:** Black square on top, white square below.\n\nThe correct option is **D** because it matches the alternating pattern observed in the rows and columns.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{D}.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
