    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nAccording to the following graph rule, the question mark is filled in with ().\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the pattern in the given sequence of shapes and their corresponding symbols.\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - The first shape is a parallelogram with a diagonal line.\n   - The second shape is a rhombus with a dot inside.\n   - The third shape is a trapezoid with a dot on one side.\n   - The fourth shape is a rectangle with a dot on one side.\n\n2. **Analyze the Symbols:**\n   - The first symbol is an arrow pointing downwards.\n   - The second symbol is a circle with rays extending from it.\n   - The third symbol is an arrow pointing to the right.\n   - The fourth symbol is an arrow pointing upwards.\n\n3. **Determine the Missing Symbol:**\n   - The missing symbol should follow the same pattern as the other symbols.\n   - The previous symbols are an arrow pointing downwards, a circle with rays, an arrow pointing to the right, and an arrow pointing upwards.\n   - The next logical direction would be an arrow pointing to the left.\n\nTherefore, the missing symbol is an arrow pointing to the left.\n\n\\boxed{C}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
