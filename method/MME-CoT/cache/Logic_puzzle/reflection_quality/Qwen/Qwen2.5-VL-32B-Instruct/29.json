    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nThe most appropriate way to fill in the question mark is ().\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of shapes in the top row and then determine which shape from the options (A, B, C, D) fits as the next element in the sequence.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the sequence\nThe sequence in the top row is:\n1. A shape with a horizontal line at the top and bottom, and vertical lines on the sides.\n2. A shape with two vertical lines on the left and right, and no horizontal lines.\n3. A shape with two vertical lines on the left and right, and a horizontal line at the bottom.\n4. A shape with two vertical lines on the left and right, and a horizontal line at the top.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the pattern\nLet's observe the changes between each shape:\n- The first shape has horizontal lines at the top and bottom, and vertical lines on the sides.\n- The second shape removes the horizontal lines but keeps the vertical lines.\n- The third shape adds a horizontal line at the bottom.\n- The fourth shape adds a horizontal line at the top.\n\nIt appears that the sequence alternates between adding and removing horizontal lines while keeping the vertical lines consistent.\n\n### Step 3: Predict the next shape\nFollowing the pattern:\n- The first shape has both top and bottom horizontal lines.\n- The second shape has no horizontal lines.\n- The third shape has a bottom horizontal line.\n- The fourth shape has a top horizontal line.\n\nThe next shape should logically have **no horizontal lines** again, similar to the second shape, since the pattern alternates between having horizontal lines and not having them.\n\n### Step 4: Match the pattern to the options\nNow, let's examine the options:\n- **Option A**: Has no horizontal lines and two vertical lines on the sides.\n- **Option B**: Has a single square shape with all four sides.\n- **Option C**: Has two vertical lines on the sides and a horizontal line at the bottom.\n- **Option D**: Has two vertical lines on the sides and a horizontal line at the top.\n\nBased on the pattern, the next shape should have **no horizontal lines** and only vertical lines on the sides. This matches **Option A**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{A}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
