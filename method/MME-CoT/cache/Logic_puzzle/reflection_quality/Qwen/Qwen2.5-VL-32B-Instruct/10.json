    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nThis template can be folded into:\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine which of the given 3D shapes (A, B, C, or D) can be formed by folding the provided net, we need to carefully analyze the pattern and connectivity of the squares in the net.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Net\nThe net consists of 6 squares arranged in a cross shape. Each square has specific markings:\n- The central square has a single dot.\n- The four surrounding squares each have two dots.\n- The outermost square (top-right) has three dots.\n\n### Step 2: Understand the Folding Process\nWhen folding the net into a cube:\n1. The central square will become one face of the cube.\n2. The four surrounding squares will fold around it to form adjacent faces.\n3. The outermost square will fold to become the top or bottom face of the cube.\n\n### Step 3: Match the Markings\nWe need to ensure that the dots on the net align correctly when folded into a cube. Let's consider the possible configurations:\n\n#### Key Observations:\n- The central square (with 1 dot) must be connected to the four squares with 2 dots.\n- The outermost square (with 3 dots) must be opposite the central square after folding.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate Each Option\n#### Option A:\n- The central square (1 dot) is not opposite the square with 3 dots.\n- The arrangement of dots does not match the net's pattern when unfolded.\n\n#### Option B:\n- The central square (1 dot) is opposite the square with 3 dots.\n- The squares with 2 dots are correctly positioned around the central square.\n- This configuration matches the net's pattern when unfolded.\n\n#### Option C:\n- The central square (1 dot) is not opposite the square with 3 dots.\n- The arrangement of dots does not match the net's pattern when unfolded.\n\n#### Option D:\n- The central square (1 dot) is not opposite the square with 3 dots.\n- The arrangement of dots does not match the net's pattern when unfolded.\n\n### Step 5: Conclusion\nAfter analyzing all options, only **Option B** correctly represents the folding of the given net into a cube.\n\nThus, the final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{B}\n\\]\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
