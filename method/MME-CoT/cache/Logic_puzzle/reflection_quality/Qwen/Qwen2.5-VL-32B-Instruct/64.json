    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nYou are given a puzzle. The puzzle consists of a question part on the top and the choices part in the bottom. The question part on the top is a set of visual panels arranged in a 2 by 3 matrix, with the bottom right piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given panels and identify any patterns or rules that govern the arrangement.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Top Row\nThe top row consists of three panels:\n- Panel 1: A curved shape resembling a \"C\".\n- Panel 2: Another curved shape resembling a \"C\".\n- Panel 3: Another curved shape resembling a \"C\".\n\n**Observation**: All three panels in the top row are identical and consist of a single curved line forming a \"C\" shape.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Bottom Row\nThe bottom row consists of two panels and one missing panel:\n- Panel 4: A zigzag shape resembling a \"7\".\n- Panel 5: Another zigzag shape resembling a \"7\".\n- Panel 6: Missing (to be determined).\n\n**Observation**: Both panels in the bottom row are identical and consist of a zigzag line forming a \"7\" shape.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Pattern\nFrom the analysis:\n- The **top row** follows a consistent pattern of a single curved line forming a \"C\" shape.\n- The **bottom row** follows a consistent pattern of a zigzag line forming a \"7\" shape.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Missing Panel\nThe missing panel (Panel 6) is part of the bottom row. Based on the observed pattern, the bottom row should continue with the zigzag \"7\" shape.\n\n### Step 5: Match the Choices\nNow, let's examine the choices provided:\n1. A curved shape resembling a \"C\".\n2. A single straight line.\n3. A triangle shape.\n4. A zigzag shape resembling a \"7\".\n\nThe missing panel should match the pattern of the bottom row, which is a zigzag \"7\" shape.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe most appropriate choice to fill the missing panel is **4**, as it matches the zigzag \"7\" pattern of the bottom row.\n\n\\boxed{4}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
