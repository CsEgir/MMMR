    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nAccording to the following graph rule, the question mark is filled in with ().\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the pattern and transformation rules in the sequence of shapes provided. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given sequence\nThe sequence of shapes is:\n1. A parallelogram with a diagonal cross.\n2. A rhombus (diamond shape).\n3. A trapezoid with a smaller rectangle on top.\n4. A square.\n\nWe need to determine the next shape in the sequence, which will replace the question mark.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the transformation rule\nLet's examine the changes between each pair of consecutive shapes:\n\n- **From Shape 1 to Shape 2**:\n  - The parallelogram becomes a rhombus.\n  - The diagonal cross disappears.\n  - This suggests a transformation from a general parallelogram to a more specific type of parallelogram (rhombus) and the removal of internal details.\n\n- **From Shape 2 to Shape 3**:\n  - The rhombus transforms into a trapezoid.\n  - A smaller rectangle is added on top.\n  - This suggests a change in the overall shape (from a quadrilateral with equal sides to a trapezoid) and the addition of a new element (the smaller rectangle).\n\n- **From Shape 3 to Shape 4**:\n  - The trapezoid with a smaller rectangle on top transforms into a square.\n  - The smaller rectangle disappears.\n  - This suggests a simplification of the shape (from a complex trapezoid to a simple square) and the removal of the additional element.\n\n### Step 3: Predict the next shape\nBased on the observed pattern:\n1. The shapes are transforming in a cyclic manner, alternating between adding and removing elements or changing the overall shape.\n2. The sequence seems to follow a pattern of simplification and complexity alternately.\n\nGiven that the last shape (Shape 4) is a simple square, the next shape should introduce some complexity or a new element. Looking at the options:\n\n- **Option A**: A curved arrow. This does not fit the pattern of geometric shapes.\n- **Option B**: A circle with a star-like pattern inside. This introduces a new, complex shape with internal details.\n- **Option C**: A cross shape. This is a simple geometric shape but does not match the complexity introduced in previous steps.\n- **Option D**: A trapezoid with a smaller rectangle on top. This is a repetition of Shape 3, which does not fit the pattern of progression.\n\n### Step 4: Choose the correct answer\nThe most logical choice is **Option B**, as it introduces a new, complex shape with internal details, following the pattern of alternating simplicity and complexity.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{B}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1.
