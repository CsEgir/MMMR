    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nWhich of the boxes comes next in the sequence? Select from A, B, C, D, and E. (A) A (B) B (C) C (D) D (E) E \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine which box comes next in the sequence, let's analyze the pattern step by step.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Shapes and Colors**:\n   - The sequence alternates between large triangles and smaller triangles.\n   - The large triangles are outlined in black, while the smaller triangles are solid black.\n\n2. **Orientation**:\n   - The large triangles have a diagonal line inside them, which appears to rotate or shift in a consistent manner.\n   - The smaller triangles do not have any internal lines.\n\n3. **Pattern of Large Triangles**:\n   - The large triangles appear every other box.\n   - The diagonal line inside the large triangles seems to rotate or shift in a specific order.\n\n4. **Pattern of Small Triangles**:\n   - The small triangles also appear every other box.\n   - They are consistently solid black without any internal lines.\n\n### Sequence Analysis:\n- **First Row**:\n  1. Large triangle with a diagonal line.\n  2. Small solid black triangle.\n  3. Large triangle with a diagonal line.\n  4. Small solid black triangle.\n  5. Large triangle with a diagonal line.\n\n- **Second Row**:\n  1. Large triangle with a diagonal line.\n  2. Small solid black triangle.\n  3. Large triangle with a diagonal line.\n  4. Small solid black triangle.\n  5. Small solid black triangle (last box).\n\n### Identifying the Next Box:\n- The sequence alternates between large triangles and small triangles.\n- The last box in the second row is a small solid black triangle (E).\n- Following the alternating pattern, the next box should be a large triangle.\n\n### Checking the Options:\n- **Option A**: Large triangle with a diagonal line.\n- **Option B**: Small solid black triangle.\n- **Option C**: Large triangle with a diagonal line.\n- **Option D**: Small solid black triangle.\n- **Option E**: Small solid black triangle.\n\nSince the next box should be a large triangle, we need to identify the correct large triangle based on the diagonal line pattern.\n\n### Diagonal Line Pattern:\n- In the large triangles, the diagonal line shifts in a consistent manner:\n  - First large triangle: Diagonal line from top-left to bottom-right.\n  - Second large triangle: Diagonal line from top-right to bottom-left.\n  - Third large triangle: Diagonal line from top-left to bottom-right.\n  - Fourth large triangle: Diagonal line from top-right to bottom-left.\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next large triangle should have a diagonal line from **top-left to bottom-right**.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe next box in the sequence is **Option A**, which is a large triangle with a diagonal line from top-left to bottom-right.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{A}\n\\]\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
