    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nYou are given a puzzle. The puzzle consists of a question part on the top and the choices in the bottom. The question part on the top is a set of visual grids arranged in a 3 by 1 sequence, with the last piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Based on a specific pattern, one option in the choice section can be classified into the same group as the question part, while the other three options are categorized into a different group. Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of visual grids in the question part and then determine which choice fits best based on that pattern.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Question Part\nThe question part consists of two grids:\n1. The first grid contains a **curved line** with a **dashed section**.\n2. The second grid also contains a **curved line** with a **dashed section**, but the orientation of the curve is different.\n\n#### Observations:\n- Both grids feature **curved lines**.\n- Both curved lines have **dashed sections**.\n- The orientation of the curves changes between the two grids.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Pattern\nThe key elements to consider are:\n1. **Shape**: Curved lines.\n2. **Style**: Dashed sections.\n3. **Orientation**: The orientation of the curves changes from one grid to the next.\n\nGiven these observations, the pattern appears to involve:\n- Maintaining the **curved shape** with **dashed sections**.\n- Changing the **orientation** of the curve in each subsequent grid.\n\n### Step 3: Evaluate the Choices\nNow, let's examine each choice to see which one fits the established pattern:\n\n#### Choice 1:\n- Contains a **straight line** with a **dashed section** and a small circle.\n- Does not match the **curved shape** seen in the question part.\n\n#### Choice 2:\n- Contains a **curved line** with a **dashed section**.\n- The orientation of the curve is different from the previous grids, which aligns with the observed pattern of changing orientations.\n\n#### Choice 3:\n- Contains a **straight line** with a **dashed section**.\n- Does not match the **curved shape** seen in the question part.\n\n#### Choice 4:\n- Contains a **curved line** with a **solid section** (no dashes).\n- Matches the **curved shape** but does not maintain the **dashed style** seen in the question part.\n\n### Step 4: Select the Most Appropriate Answer\nBased on the analysis:\n- Choice 2 is the only option that maintains both the **curved shape** and the **dashed style**, while also changing the orientation of the curve as per the observed pattern.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{2}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
