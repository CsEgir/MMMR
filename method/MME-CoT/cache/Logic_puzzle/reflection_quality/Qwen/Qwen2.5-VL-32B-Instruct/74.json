    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nYou are given a puzzle. The puzzle consists of a question part on the top and the choices part in the bottom. The question part on the top is a set of visual panels arranged in a 2 by 3 matrix, with the bottom right piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given panels and identify any patterns or rules that govern the arrangement.\n\n### Step 1: Examine the Top Row\nThe top row contains the following shapes:\n1. A **circle**.\n2. A **horizontal ellipse**.\n3. A **zigzag line**.\n\n### Step 2: Examine the Bottom Row\nThe bottom row contains the following shapes (so far):\n1. A **square**.\n2. A **horizontal line segment**.\n3. The missing piece.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Patterns\nWe need to determine the relationship between the shapes in the top row and the corresponding shapes in the bottom row.\n\n#### Pattern Analysis:\n- **Top Left (Circle)** → **Bottom Left (Square)**:\n  - The circle is a closed, rounded shape.\n  - The square is a closed, angular shape.\n  - This suggests a transformation from a rounded shape to an angular shape.\n\n- **Top Middle (Horizontal Ellipse)** → **Bottom Middle (Horizontal Line Segment)**:\n  - The horizontal ellipse is a stretched, rounded shape.\n  - The horizontal line segment is a straight, angular shape.\n  - Again, this suggests a transformation from a rounded shape to an angular shape.\n\n- **Top Right (Zigzag Line)** → **Bottom Right (Missing Piece)**:\n  - The zigzag line is already an angular shape.\n  - Following the pattern, we should look for an angular shape that corresponds to the zigzag line.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Choices\nThe choices are:\n1. A **T-shaped figure**.\n2. A **plus sign (+)**.\n3. Another **T-shaped figure** (slightly different orientation).\n4. A **cross with one longer arm**.\n\n#### Applying the Pattern:\n- The zigzag line is angular, so the missing piece should also be angular.\n- Among the choices, all options are angular, but we need to find the one that best fits the sequence.\n\n#### Logical Choice:\n- The plus sign (+) in choice **2** is a simple, symmetrical angular shape that aligns well with the pattern of transforming rounded shapes into angular shapes.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{2}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
    "valid_outputs": "```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"The solution correctly identifies the pattern of transforming rounded shapes into angular shapes and selects choice 2 (plus sign) as the best fit.\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A\"\n  }\n]\n```",
