    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\n Which of the boxes comes next in the sequence? Select from A, B,  C, D, and E.  (A) A (B) B (C) C (D) D (E) E\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine which box comes next in the sequence, let's analyze the pattern step by step.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Top Row:**\n   - The sequence shows a progression of shapes and their transformations.\n   - The shapes are:\n     - A triangle (`▲`)\n     - A square (`□`)\n     - Another triangle (`▲`)\n     - A combination of a square and a triangle (`□ + ▲`)\n     - A smaller triangle (`▲`)\n\n2. **Bottom Row:**\n   - The sequence appears to follow a similar pattern but with different shapes and orientations.\n   - The shapes are:\n     - A square (`□`)\n     - A triangle (`▲`)\n     - Another square (`□`)\n     - A combination of a square and a triangle (`□ + ▲`)\n     - A triangle (`▲`)\n\n3. **Key Patterns:**\n   - The top row alternates between triangles and squares, with some transformations involving combining shapes.\n   - The bottom row also alternates between squares and triangles, following a similar transformation logic.\n\n### Step-by-Step Analysis:\n- **Top Row:**\n  - The first shape is a triangle (`▲`).\n  - The second shape is a square (`□`).\n  - The third shape is another triangle (`▲`).\n  - The fourth shape combines a square and a triangle (`□ + ▲`).\n  - The fifth shape is a smaller triangle (`▲`).\n\n- **Bottom Row:**\n  - The first shape is a square (`□`).\n  - The second shape is a triangle (`▲`).\n  - The third shape is another square (`□`).\n  - The fourth shape combines a square and a triangle (`□ + ▲`).\n  - The fifth shape should logically be a smaller triangle (`▲`), following the pattern of the top row.\n\n### Matching the Options:\n- **Option A:** Shows a square (`□`) above a triangle (`▲`).\n- **Option B:** Shows a triangle (`▲`) above a triangle (`▲`).\n- **Option C:** Shows a square (`□`) above a triangle (`▲`).\n- **Option D:** Shows a square (`□`) above a triangle (`▲`).\n- **Option E:** Shows a triangle (`▲`) above a triangle (`▲`).\n\nFrom the analysis, the next shape in the sequence should be a smaller triangle (`▲`). Among the options, **Option B** matches this description.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{B}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
