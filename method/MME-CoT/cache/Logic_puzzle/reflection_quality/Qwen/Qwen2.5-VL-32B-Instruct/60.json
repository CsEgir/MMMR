    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nFrom the following four figures, find one figure with different patterns from the other three ().\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this problem, we need to carefully analyze the patterns in each figure and identify any differences. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Figures\nEach figure consists of a 2x2 grid with symbols in each cell. The symbols are:\n- A lightning bolt (⚡)\n- An arrow pointing clockwise (↻)\n\nWe will examine the arrangement of these symbols in each figure.\n\n#### Figure A:\n```\n+---+---+\n|   | ⚡ |\n+---+---+\n| ⚡ | ↻ |\n+---+---+\n```\n\n#### Figure B:\n```\n+---+---+\n| ⚡ | ⚡ |\n+---+---+\n|   | ↻ |\n+---+---+\n```\n\n#### Figure C:\n```\n+---+---+\n| ⚡ |   |\n+---+---+\n|   | ↻ |\n+---+---+\n```\n\n#### Figure D:\n```\n+---+---+\n| ⚡ |   |\n+---+---+\n| ↻ | ⚡ |\n+---+---+\n```\n\n### Step 2: Identify Patterns\nNow, let's look for any consistent patterns or rules that might help us distinguish one figure from the others.\n\n#### Observation 1: Distribution of Symbols\n- In Figures A, B, and C, the arrow (↻) appears only once in the bottom-right cell.\n- In Figure D, the arrow (↻) is in the bottom-left cell, which is different from the other three figures.\n\n#### Observation 2: Placement of Lightning Bolts (⚡)\n- In Figures A, B, and C, the lightning bolts are distributed such that there is at least one empty cell in the grid.\n- In Figure D, all cells except the bottom-left one contain either a lightning bolt or an arrow.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Odd One Out\nFrom the observations:\n- Figures A, B, and C share a common pattern where the arrow is consistently placed in the bottom-right cell.\n- Figure D breaks this pattern by placing the arrow in the bottom-left cell and having a different distribution of symbols.\n\nThus, **Figure D** is the one with a different pattern from the other three.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
