    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nPlease choose the most suitable one from the four options given to make it appear regular.（）\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine the most suitable option to make the sequence appear regular, let's analyze the given images step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the First Row\nThe first row contains three shapes:\n1. A **frustum of a cone** (a truncated cone).\n2. A **frustum of a pyramid** (a truncated pyramid).\n3. Another **frustum of a cone**.\n\nFrom this, we observe that the shapes in the first row are all **truncated versions of cones or pyramids**.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Second Row\nThe second row contains two shapes:\n1. A **frustum of a cylinder**.\n2. A **frustum of a cone**.\n\nThe third shape in the second row is missing, and we need to choose an option that fits the pattern observed in the first row.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the Pattern\nThe pattern in both rows is that each shape is a **frustum** (a truncated version) of a 3D geometric solid. Specifically:\n- The first row includes frustums of a cone, a pyramid, and another cone.\n- The second row includes frustums of a cylinder and a cone.\n\nThus, the missing shape in the second row should also be a **frustum** of a 3D geometric solid.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Options\nNow, let's evaluate the given options:\n- **Option A**: A **cone**. This is not a frustum; it is a complete cone.\n- **Option B**: A **cube**. This is not a frustum; it is a complete cube.\n- **Option C**: A **cube**. This is not a frustum; it is a complete cube.\n- **Option D**: A **frustum of a cube** (a truncated cube). This is a frustum of a 3D geometric solid.\n\n### Step 5: Choose the Most Suitable Option\nThe only option that fits the pattern of being a frustum of a 3D geometric solid is **Option D**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
    "valid_outputs": "```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"The reflection step correctly identifies that the missing shape should be a frustum of a cube, aligning with the ground truth.\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A\"\n  }\n]\n```",
