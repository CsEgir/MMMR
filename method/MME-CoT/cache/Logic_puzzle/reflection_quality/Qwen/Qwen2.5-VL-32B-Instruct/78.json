    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nWhich option from A-E should replace the question mark to follow the pattern present above the separating line? (select from A-E)\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence of symbols above the separating line and then determine which option from A-E follows that pattern.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given sequence\nThe sequence above the separating line is:\n1. ☉\n2. ⚫\n3. ☉\n4. ⚫\n5. ☉\n6. ?\n\nEach symbol alternates between two distinct patterns:\n- The first pattern is a circle with a smaller concentric circle inside it (e.g., ☉).\n- The second pattern is a circle with a crosshair inside it (e.g., ⚫).\n\n### Step 2: Identify the pattern\nThe sequence alternates as follows:\n- First symbol: ☉\n- Second symbol: ⚫\n- Third symbol: ☉\n- Fourth symbol: ⚫\n- Fifth symbol: ☉\n\nFrom this, we can see that the sequence alternates between the two patterns. Since the fifth symbol is ☉, the sixth symbol should be ⚫ to maintain the alternating pattern.\n\n### Step 3: Match the pattern to the options\nNow, we need to find the option that corresponds to the ⚫ pattern:\n- Option A: ☉\n- Option B: ⚫\n- Option C: ☉\n- Option D: ☉\n- Option E: ☉\n\nThe correct option is **B**, which matches the ⚫ pattern.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{B}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
