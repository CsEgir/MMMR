    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\n\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of shapes in the top row and then determine which shape from the bottom row fits the next position in the sequence.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the shapes in the top row\nThe top row contains three shapes:\n1. The first shape is a pentagonal pyramid.\n2. The second shape is a hexagonal prism.\n3. The third shape is a heptagonal pyramid.\n\n#### Observations:\n- The base of each shape is a polygon with an increasing number of sides:\n  - First shape: Pentagon (5 sides)\n  - Second shape: Hexagon (6 sides)\n  - Third shape: Heptagon (7 sides)\n\n#### Pattern:\nThe sequence appears to follow an increasing order of the number of sides of the base polygon:\n- Pentagon → Hexagon → Heptagon\n\n### Step 2: Determine the next shape in the sequence\nFollowing the pattern, the next shape should have a base with 8 sides, which is an **octagon**.\n\n### Step 3: Identify the correct shape from the options\nNow, we examine the shapes in the bottom row to find the one with an octagonal base:\n- **A**: This is a cube, which has square faces.\n- **B**: This is a hexagonal prism, which has a hexagonal base.\n- **C**: This is a heptagonal pyramid, which has a heptagonal base.\n- **D**: This is an octagonal prism, which has an octagonal base.\n- **E**: This is a nonagon (9-sided polygon) pyramid, which has a nonagonal base.\n\nThe shape with an octagonal base is **D**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
