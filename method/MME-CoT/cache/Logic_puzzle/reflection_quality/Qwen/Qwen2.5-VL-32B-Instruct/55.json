    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\n<image>The image displays an intelligence test question featuring a 3x3 grid with nine boxes, where the 9th box is marked with a question mark (?). Your task is to select the correct shape from eight options (labeled A to H) to fill the 9th box, completing the pattern that links all the shapes together.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this intelligence test question, we need to identify the pattern that links the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Rows and Columns\nThe grid consists of three rows and three columns. We will look for patterns in both rows and columns.\n\n#### Row 1:\n- First box: A black pentagon.\n- Second box: A gray hexagon.\n- Third box: A white circle.\n\n#### Row 2:\n- First box: A white pentagon.\n- Second box: A black hexagon.\n- Third box: A gray circle.\n\n#### Row 3:\n- First box: A gray pentagon.\n- Second box: A white hexagon.\n- Third box: The question mark (?).\n\n#### Column 1:\n- First box: A black pentagon.\n- Second box: A white pentagon.\n- Third box: A gray pentagon.\n\n#### Column 2:\n- First box: A gray hexagon.\n- Second box: A black hexagon.\n- Third box: A white hexagon.\n\n#### Column 3:\n- First box: A white circle.\n- Second box: A gray circle.\n- Third box: The question mark (?).\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Pattern\nFrom the analysis:\n1. **Shapes in each row and column follow a sequence of colors:**\n   - Row 1: Black, Gray, White.\n   - Row 2: White, Black, Gray.\n   - Row 3: Gray, White, ? (should be Black).\n   - Column 1: Black, White, Gray.\n   - Column 2: Gray, Black, White.\n   - Column 3: White, Gray, ? (should be Black).\n\n2. **Shapes in each row and column follow a sequence of geometric forms:**\n   - Row 1: Pentagon, Hexagon, Circle.\n   - Row 2: Pentagon, Hexagon, Circle.\n   - Row 3: Pentagon, Hexagon, ? (should be Circle).\n   - Column 1: Pentagon, Pentagon, Pentagon.\n   - Column 2: Hexagon, Hexagon, Hexagon.\n   - Column 3: Circle, Circle, ? (should be Circle).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Missing Shape\n- The missing shape in the third row and third column should be a **black circle** because:\n  - The color pattern dictates it should be black.\n  - The shape pattern dictates it should be a circle.\n\n### Step 4: Match the Shape with the Options\nFrom the given options (A to H):\n- Option D is a black circle.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
