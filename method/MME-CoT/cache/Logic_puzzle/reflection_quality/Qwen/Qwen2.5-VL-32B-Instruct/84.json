    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nWhich of the boxes comes next in the sequence? Select from A, B, C, D, and E. (A) A (B) B (C) C (D) D (E) E \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine which box comes next in the sequence, let's analyze the patterns in the given sequence step by step.\n\n### Observations:\n1. **Top Row:**\n   - The sequence alternates between a circle and a filled circle.\n   - The shapes below the circle/filled circle change systematically.\n\n2. **Bottom Row:**\n   - We need to identify the pattern that continues from the top row.\n\n### Detailed Analysis:\n#### Top Row Patterns:\n- **First Box:** Circle (white), Triangle (black), Rectangle (black).\n- **Second Box:** Filled Circle (black), Triangle (black), Rectangle (black).\n- **Third Box:** Circle (white), Triangle (black), Rectangle (black) with one additional small black rectangle.\n- **Fourth Box:** Filled Circle (black), Triangle (black), Rectangle (black) with two additional small black rectangles.\n- **Fifth Box:** Circle (white), Triangle (black), Rectangle (black) with three additional small black rectangles.\n\n#### Bottom Row Patterns:\n- **First Box:** Filled Circle (black), Triangle (black), Rectangle (black).\n- **Second Box:** Filled Circle (black), Triangle (black), Rectangle (black) with four additional small black rectangles.\n- **Third Box:** Filled Circle (black), Triangle (black), Rectangle (black) with five additional small black rectangles.\n- **Fourth Box:** Filled Circle (black), Triangle (black), Rectangle (black) with six additional small black rectangles.\n- **Fifth Box:** Circle (white), Triangle (black), Rectangle (black) with seven additional small black rectangles.\n\n### Identifying the Next Pattern:\n- The sequence alternates between a circle and a filled circle.\n- The number of additional small black rectangles increases by one in each subsequent box.\n\n#### Current State:\n- The last box in the bottom row has a circle (white) and seven additional small black rectangles.\n- Following the alternating pattern, the next box should have a filled circle (black).\n\n#### Predicting the Next Box:\n- The next box should have a filled circle (black).\n- The number of additional small black rectangles should increase by one, making it eight.\n\n### Matching the Options:\n- **Option A:** Filled Circle (black), Triangle (black), Rectangle (black) with three additional small black rectangles.\n- **Option B:** Filled Circle (black), Triangle (black), Rectangle (black) with eight additional small black rectangles.\n- **Option C:** Filled Circle (black), Triangle (black), Rectangle (black) with five additional small black rectangles.\n- **Option D:** Filled Circle (black), Triangle (black), Rectangle (black) with two additional small black rectangles.\n- **Option E:** Circle (white), Triangle (black), Rectangle (black) with seven additional small black rectangles.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe correct option is **B**, as it matches the pattern of having a filled circle (black) and eight additional small black rectangles.\n\n\\boxed{B}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
