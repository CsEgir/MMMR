    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nAmong the following options, the one that conforms to the change rule of the given graph is ().\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the given graph and identify the pattern or rule governing the changes in the shapes. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Given Graph\nThe graph consists of a 3x3 grid with various shapes in each cell. Each shape appears to have a specific structure involving a combination of geometric elements (e.g., squares, triangles, circles). We need to observe how these shapes change across rows and columns.\n\n#### Rows:\n- **Row 1**: The shapes are:\n  - Top-left: A square house with a small square door.\n  - Top-middle: A triangular roof with a small triangle door.\n  - Top-right: A circular roof with a small circle door.\n  \n- **Row 2**: The shapes are:\n  - Middle-left: A small square.\n  - Middle-middle: A circular roof with a small circle door.\n  - Middle-right: A triangular roof with a small triangle door.\n  \n- **Row 3**: The shapes are:\n  - Bottom-left: A triangular roof with a small triangle door.\n  - Bottom-middle: A square house with a small square door.\n  - Bottom-right: A question mark (?), which we need to determine.\n\n#### Columns:\n- **Column 1**: The shapes are:\n  - Top: A square house with a small square door.\n  - Middle: A small square.\n  - Bottom: A triangular roof with a small triangle door.\n  \n- **Column 2**: The shapes are:\n  - Top: A triangular roof with a small triangle door.\n  - Middle: A circular roof with a small circle door.\n  - Bottom: A square house with a small square door.\n  \n- **Column 3**: The shapes are:\n  - Top: A circular roof with a small circle door.\n  - Middle: A triangular roof with a small triangle door.\n  - Bottom: A question mark (?).\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Pattern\nFrom the analysis, we can observe the following patterns:\n1. **Shape Transformation Across Rows**:\n   - In each row, the shapes seem to cycle through different types of roofs and doors (square, triangle, circle).\n   - For example, Row 1 has square, triangle, and circle; Row 2 has square, circle, and triangle; Row 3 has triangle, square, and ?.\n\n2. **Shape Transformation Across Columns**:\n   - In each column, the shapes also cycle through different types of roofs and doors.\n   - For example, Column 1 has square, square, and triangle; Column 2 has triangle, circle, and square; Column 3 has circle, triangle, and ?.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Missing Shape\nTo find the missing shape in the bottom-right cell (question mark), we need to follow the observed pattern:\n- **Row 3**: The shapes are triangular, square, and ?. Based on the cycling pattern, the next shape should be a circular roof with a small circle door.\n- **Column 3**: The shapes are circular, triangular, and ?. Based on the cycling pattern, the next shape should also be a circular roof with a small circle door.\n\nThus, the missing shape must be a circular roof with a small circle door.\n\n### Step 4: Match with the Options\nNow, let's match the determined shape with the given options:\n- **Option A**: A triangular roof with a small triangle door.\n- **Option B**: A square house with a small square door.\n- **Option C**: A circular roof with a small circle door.\n- **Option D**: A triangular roof with a small triangle door.\n\nThe correct shape is **Option C**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
    "valid_outputs": "```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"The solution correctly identifies the missing shape as a circular roof with a small circle door.\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A\"\n  }\n]\n```",
