    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\n<image>The image displays an intelligence test question featuring a 3x3 grid with nine boxes, where the 9th box is marked with a question mark (?). Your task is to select the correct shape from eight options (labeled A to H) to fill the 9th box, completing the pattern that links all the shapes together.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this intelligence test question, we need to identify the pattern that links the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Observe the grid\nThe grid is divided into three rows and three columns. Each cell contains a shape, and the goal is to determine the missing shape in the bottom-right cell (the 9th box).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the shapes\n#### Row 1:\n- The first box contains a **gray circle**.\n- The second box contains a **white circle**.\n- The third box contains a **gray circle**.\n\n#### Row 2:\n- The first box contains a **large gray circle**.\n- The second box contains a **medium gray circle**.\n- The third box contains a **small white circle**.\n\n#### Row 3:\n- The first box contains a **black square**.\n- The second box contains a **white square**.\n- The third box is empty (marked with a question mark).\n\n### Step 3: Identify patterns\n#### Pattern in Rows:\n- **Row 1**: All shapes are circles.\n- **Row 2**: All shapes are circles, but their sizes vary (large, medium, small).\n- **Row 3**: The first two shapes are squares (black and white). This suggests that the third shape in Row 3 should also be a square.\n\n#### Pattern in Columns:\n- **Column 1**: The shapes are a circle, a large circle, and a square. This suggests a transition from circles to squares.\n- **Column 2**: The shapes are a circle, a medium circle, and a square. Again, this suggests a transition from circles to squares.\n- **Column 3**: The shapes are a circle, a small circle, and a question mark. This suggests that the missing shape should be a square to maintain the transition pattern.\n\n### Step 4: Determine the missing shape\nFrom the analysis:\n- The missing shape must be a **square** to complete the pattern in both rows and columns.\n- The color of the square in the third column should match the color of the square in the second column (white).\n\n### Step 5: Select the correct option\nAmong the given options (A to H):\n- Option **D** is a **white square**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
