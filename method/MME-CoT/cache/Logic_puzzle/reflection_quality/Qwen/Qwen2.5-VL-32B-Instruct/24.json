    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nPlease choose the most suitable one from the four options given and fill in the question mark to make it show a certain pattern ().\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the arrangement of the shapes in the grid. Let's analyze the given grid step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Grid\nThe grid is a 3x3 matrix with some shapes already filled in and one missing shape (denoted by \"?\"). The goal is to determine the missing shape based on the patterns observed in the rows and columns.\n\n#### Rows:\n- **Row 1**: Contains shapes with 4 sides (square-like structures).\n- **Row 2**: Contains shapes with 5 sides (pentagon-like structures).\n- **Row 3**: Contains shapes with 6 sides (hexagon-like structures).\n\n#### Columns:\n- **Column 1**: Contains shapes with a vertical line dividing them into two parts.\n- **Column 2**: Contains shapes with a horizontal line dividing them into two parts.\n- **Column 3**: Contains shapes with diagonal lines dividing them into two parts.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Missing Shape\nThe missing shape is in the bottom-right corner of the grid (Row 3, Column 3). Based on the patterns observed:\n- **Row 3** should contain a shape with 6 sides (a hexagon-like structure).\n- **Column 3** should contain a shape with diagonal lines dividing it into two parts.\n\n### Step 3: Match the Options\nNow, let's examine the provided options (A, B, C, D) to find the one that fits both criteria:\n- **Option A**: A circle divided by a vertical line. This does not fit Row 3 (6 sides) or Column 3 (diagonal division).\n- **Option B**: A square divided by a horizontal line. This does not fit Row 3 (6 sides) or Column 3 (diagonal division).\n- **Option C**: A triangle divided by a diagonal line. This does not fit Row 3 (6 sides).\n- **Option D**: A hexagon divided by a diagonal line. This fits both Row 3 (6 sides) and Column 3 (diagonal division).\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe most suitable shape to fill in the missing position is **Option D**.\n\n\\boxed{D}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
    "valid_outputs": "```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"The solution correctly identifies the missing shape as Option D, a hexagon divided by a diagonal line.\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A\"\n  }\n]\n```",
