    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nWhich of the boxes comes next in the sequence? Select from A, B, C, D, and E. (A) A (B) B (C) C (D) D (E) E \n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine which box comes next in the sequence, let's analyze the pattern step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the sequence\nThe sequence provided is:\n1. A full black circle.\n2. A white quarter-circle (pie slice).\n3. A small black dot.\n4. A white half-moon shape.\n5. A full black circle.\n\n### Step 2: Look for repeating patterns\nThe sequence alternates between **black shapes** and **white shapes**:\n- Black: Full circle → Dot\n- White: Quarter-circle → Half-moon\n\n### Step 3: Determine the next shape\nThe sequence so far is:\n1. Black: Full circle\n2. White: Quarter-circle\n3. Black: Dot\n4. White: Half-moon\n5. Black: Full circle\n\nThe next shape should be **white**, following the alternating pattern.\n\n### Step 4: Analyze the options\nThe options are:\n- **A**: White quarter-circle (pie slice)\n- **B**: Black dot\n- **C**: White half-moon\n- **D**: White circle\n- **E**: Black quarter-circle\n\nSince the next shape should be white and we have already seen a white quarter-circle and a white half-moon, the most logical choice is a **white circle**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
