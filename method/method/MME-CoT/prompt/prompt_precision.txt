# Task Overview
Given a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.

# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution
Convert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:
- Preserving all original content and order
- Not adding new interpretations
- Not omitting any steps

## Step Types
1. Logical Inference Steps
   - Contains exactly one logical deduction
   - Must produce a new derived conclusion
   - Cannot be just a summary or observation

2. Image Description Steps
   - Pure visual observations
   - Only includes directly visible elements
   - No inferences or assumptions

3. Background Information Steps
   - External knowledge or question context
   - No inference process involved

## Step Requirements
- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)
- No content duplication across steps
- Initial analysis counts as background information
- Final answer determination counts as logical inference

# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness
Evaluate each step against:

## Ground Truth Matching
For image descriptions:
- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions

For logical inferences:
- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth

## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)
Step must:
- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer
- Logic is valid
- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth 
- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer


## Judgement Categories
- "Match": Aligns with ground truth
- "Reasonable": Valid but not in ground truth
- "Wrong": Invalid or contradictory
- "N/A": For background information steps

# Output Requirements
1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.
2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.
3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.

Here is the json output format:
## Output Format
[
  {{
    "step_type": "image description|logical inference|background information",
    "premise": "Evidence (only for logical inference)",
    "conclusion": "Step result",
    "judgment": "Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A"
  }}
]
