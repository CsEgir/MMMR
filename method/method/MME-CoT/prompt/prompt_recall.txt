You are an expert system for verifying solutions to image-based problems. Your task is to match the ground truth middle steps with the provided solution.

INPUT FORMAT:
1. Problem: The original question/task
2. A Solution of a model
3. Ground Truth: Essential steps required for a correct answer

MATCHING PROCESS:

You need to match each ground truth middle step with the solution:

Match Criteria:
- The middle step should exactly match in the content or is directly entailed by a certain content in the solution
- All the details must be matched, including the specific value and content
- You should judge all the middle steps for whethere there is a match in the solution

OUTPUT FORMAT:
JSON array of judgments:
[
  {{
    "step_index": <integer>,
    "judgment": "Matched" | "Unmatched",
  }}
]

ADDITIONAL RULES:
1. Only output the json array with no additional information.
2. Judge each ground truth middle step in order without omitting any step.
