Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Relevancy\nA relevant step is considered as: 75% content of the step must be related to trying to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) to the question. \n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: \nEvaluate relevancy independent of correctness. As long as the step is trying to get to a solution, it is considered relevant. Logical fallacy, knowledge mistake, inconsistent with previous steps, or other mistakes do not affect relevance.\nA logically wrong step can be relevant if the reasoning attempts to address the question.\n\nThe following behaviour is considered as relevant:\ni. The step is planning, summarizing, thinking, verifying, calculating, or confirming an intermediate/final conclusion helpful to get a solution.\nii. The step is summarizing or reflecting on previously reached conclusion relevant to get a solution.\niii. Repeating the information in the question or give the final answer.\niv. A relevant image depiction shoule be in one of following situation: 1. help to obtain a conclusion helpful to solve the question later; 2. help to identify certain patterns in the image later; 3. directly contributes to the answer\nv. Depicting or analyzing the options of the question is also relevant.\nvi. Repeating previous relevant steps are also considered relevant. \n\nThe following behaviour is considered as irrelevant: \ni. Depicting image information that does not related to what is asking in the question.  Example: The question asks how many cars are present in all the images. If the step focuses on other visual elements like the road or building, the step is considered as irrelevant.\nii. Self-thought not related to what the question is asking.\niii. Other information that is tangential for answering the question.\n\n\n# Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"A brief summary of step result\",\n    \"relevant\": \"Yes|No\"\n  }\n]\n\n\n# Output Rules\nDirect JSON output without any other output\nOutput at most 40 steps\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nThere are two points at -2 and 1 on the number line. Write the set of numbers represented on the number line in interval notation.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nSo I've got this problem here. It says there are two points on a number line at -2 and 1. There's a line that's shaded between these two points, I assume, since it's mentioned that there are points at -2 and 1. The task is to write the set of numbers represented on this number line in interval notation.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what's being shown on the number line. There are two points marked: one at -2 and one at 1. Between these two points, there's probably a line shaded, indicating all the numbers between -2 and 1 are included.\n\nNow, interval notation is a way to represent a set of real numbers using inequalities. It usually involves parentheses ( ) and brackets [ ] to show whether the endpoints are included or not.\n\nSince the problem mentions \"points\" at -2 and 1, I need to pay attention to how these points are represented. If they're closed circles, that means the points are included in the interval. If they're open circles, the points are not included.\n\nLooking back at the problem, it says \"points at -2 and 1,\" but in the text, it's written as \"-2 and 1,\" which might indicate open circles because often, open circles denote exclusion of the point.\n\nWait, but that seems counterintuitive because typically, open circles mean the points are not included, and closed circles mean they are included.\n\nBut in this case, the problem says \"points at -2 and 1,\" which might imply that those points are included. Maybe I need to look closer.\n\nActually, re-reading the problem, it says: \"There are two points at -2 and 1 on the number line. Write the set of numbers represented on the number line in interval notation.\"\n\nGiven that, it seems like the points at -2 and 1 are included because they are specifically mentioned as \"points at -2 and 1.\"\n\nTherefore, the interval should include both -2 and 1.\n\nSo, the set of numbers would be from -2 to 1, including both endpoints.\n\nIn interval notation, that would be written as [-2, 1].\n\nWait a minute, but if the points are open circles, which sometimes are denoted differently, but in this case, since they are \"points at -2 and 1,\" I think they are included.\n\nAlternatively, sometimes open circles are used to indicate points that are not included, but in this context, since they are specified as \"points at -2 and 1,\" I'll assume they are included.\n\nTherefore, the correct interval notation should be [-2, 1].\n\nBut just to make sure, let's consider if there's any other possibility.\n\nIf both -2 and 1 are included, then it's a closed interval from -2 to 1.\n\nIf they were not included, it would be (-2, 1), which means all numbers between -2 and 1 but not including -2 and 1 themselves.\n\nBut given that the points are at -2 and 1, I think they are included.\n\nAlternatively, if the points were open circles, it would mean they are not included, but in this case, since they are \"points at -2 and 1,\" I'll interpret that as included.\n\nSo, my final answer is [-2, 1].\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{[-2,1]} \\]",
