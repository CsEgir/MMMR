    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\n<image>The image displays an intelligence test question in the form of a matrix pattern puzzle. There are eight shapes provided, with one space left blank, indicated by a question mark. The shapes are organized into three rows, each containing three boxes. Your task is to select the correct shape from six options (labeled A to F) to fill the empty box, completing the pattern that links all the shapes together.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this matrix pattern puzzle, we need to identify the underlying rules governing the arrangement of shapes in the rows and columns. Let's analyze the given matrix step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Rows\nThe matrix has three rows, each containing three boxes. We will examine the patterns within each row.\n\n#### Row 1:\n- Box 1: A vertical line with a purple square on the left.\n- Box 2: A single vertical line.\n- Box 3: A vertical line with a purple square on the right.\n\n#### Row 2:\n- Box 1: A single vertical line.\n- Box 2: Two vertical lines.\n- Box 3: Three vertical lines.\n\n#### Row 3:\n- Box 1: A vertical line with a purple square on the left.\n- Box 2: Two vertical lines.\n- Box 3: (Blank, indicated by a question mark).\n\n### Step 2: Identify Patterns\nFrom the analysis of the rows, we can observe the following patterns:\n\n1. **Vertical Lines**:\n   - Row 1: 1 line → 1 line → 1 line.\n   - Row 2: 1 line → 2 lines → 3 lines.\n   - Row 3: 1 line → 2 lines → ? lines.\n     - The number of vertical lines increases by 1 in each subsequent box within a row.\n\n2. **Purple Squares**:\n   - Row 1: Purple square on the left → No square → Purple square on the right.\n   - Row 2: No square → No square → No square.\n   - Row 3: Purple square on the left → No square → ?\n     - The presence of purple squares alternates between rows and follows a specific side pattern.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Missing Shape\nUsing the observed patterns:\n- In Row 3, the number of vertical lines should increase sequentially: 1 → 2 → 3.\n- The purple square alternates sides and is present in the first box of Row 3. Following this pattern, the third box should have a purple square on the right.\n\nThus, the missing shape should have:\n- 3 vertical lines.\n- A purple square on the right.\n\n### Step 4: Match the Options\nNow, let's match these characteristics with the provided options (A to F):\n- **Option A**: 1 vertical line, purple square on the left.\n- **Option B**: 1 vertical line, no square.\n- **Option C**: 1 vertical line, purple square on the right.\n- **Option D**: 1 vertical line, purple square on the left.\n- **Option E**: 3 vertical lines, no square.\n- **Option F**: 3 vertical lines, purple square on the right.\n\nThe correct shape is **Option F**, which has 3 vertical lines and a purple square on the right.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{F}\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nD",
