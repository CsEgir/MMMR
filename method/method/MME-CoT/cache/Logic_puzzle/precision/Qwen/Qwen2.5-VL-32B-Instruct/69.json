    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nFrom the four options given, choose the most suitable one and fill in the question mark to make it show a certain regularity.（）\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of the given images and then determine which option fits best as the next image in the sequence.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Given Sequence\nThe sequence consists of four images, each a 3x3 grid with black and white squares. Let's examine the patterns:\n\n1. **First Image**:  \n   ```\n   □□□\n   □■□\n   □□□\n   ```\n\n2. **Second Image**:  \n   ```\n   □□□\n   ■□□\n   □□□\n   ```\n\n3. **Third Image**:  \n   ```\n   □□□\n   □□■\n   □□□\n   ```\n\n4. **Fourth Image**:  \n   ```\n   □□□\n   □□□\n   □■□\n   ```\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Pattern\n- In each image, there is exactly **one black square**.\n- The position of the black square changes in a specific order:\n  - First image: Center row, left column.\n  - Second image: Center row, middle column.\n  - Third image: Center row, right column.\n  - Fourth image: Bottom row, center column.\n\n### Step 3: Predict the Next Position\nFollowing the observed pattern, the black square moves one step at a time in a clockwise direction around the center row and then shifts to the bottom row. The next position should be:\n- Top row, center column.\n\n### Step 4: Match the Pattern with the Options\nNow, let's check the options to see which one matches the predicted pattern:\n\n- **Option A**:  \n  ```\n  □□□\n  □□□\n  □□□\n  ```  \n  (This has no black square, so it does not fit.)\n\n- **Option B**:  \n  ```\n  □□□\n  □□□\n  □□□\n  ```  \n  (This also has no black square, so it does not fit.)\n\n- **Option C**:  \n  ```\n  □□□\n  □□□\n  □□□\n  ```  \n  (This has no black square, so it does not fit.)\n\n- **Option D**:  \n  ```\n  □□□\n  □□□\n  □□□\n  ```  \n  (This has no black square, so it does not fit.)\n\n### Final Answer:\nAfter re-evaluating the options, it appears there might be a mistake in the provided options. However, based on the pattern, the correct next image should have a black square in the top row, center column. If the options were correctly listed, the answer would be:\n\n\\boxed{D}\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nD",
