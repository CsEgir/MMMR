Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\n<image>The image displays an intelligence test question in the form of a matrix pattern puzzle. There are eight shapes provided, with one space left blank, indicated by a question mark. The shapes are organized into three rows, each containing three boxes. Your task is to select the correct shape from six options (labeled A to F) to fill the empty box, completing the pattern that links all the shapes together.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this matrix pattern puzzle, we need to analyze the given shapes and identify the underlying pattern. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Rows and Columns\nThe matrix consists of three rows and three columns. We need to determine the relationship between the shapes in each row and column.\n\n#### Row 1:\n- The first shape has two dots at the top corners.\n- The second shape has two dots at the bottom corners.\n- The third shape has two dots on the left and right sides.\n\n#### Row 2:\n- The first shape has one dot on the left side.\n- The second shape has one dot on the top.\n- The third shape has one dot on the right side.\n\n#### Row 3:\n- The first shape has one dot on the bottom.\n- The second shape has one dot on the top.\n- The third shape is missing, indicated by a question mark.\n\n#### Column 1:\n- The first shape has two dots at the top corners.\n- The second shape has one dot on the left side.\n- The third shape has one dot on the bottom.\n\n#### Column 2:\n- The first shape has two dots at the bottom corners.\n- The second shape has one dot on the top.\n- The third shape has one dot on the top.\n\n#### Column 3:\n- The first shape has two dots on the left and right sides.\n- The second shape has one dot on the right side.\n- The third shape is missing.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Pattern\nFrom the analysis:\n- **Row-wise**: Each row seems to follow a consistent pattern of dot placement.\n- **Column-wise**: Each column also follows a consistent pattern of dot placement.\n\n#### Observations:\n1. **Row 1**: The dots are placed symmetrically (top corners, bottom corners, left-right sides).\n2. **Row 2**: The dots are placed asymmetrically (left, top, right).\n3. **Row 3**: The dots are placed asymmetrically (bottom, top, ?).\n\n#### Missing Shape in Row 3:\n- The first shape in Row 3 has a dot on the bottom.\n- The second shape in Row 3 has a dot on the top.\n- The third shape should logically have a dot on the left or right side to complete the asymmetrical pattern.\n\n### Step 3: Match the Options\nNow, let's examine the options (A to F) to find the shape that fits the pattern:\n\n- **Option A**: Has a dot on the left side.\n- **Option B**: Has a dot on the top.\n- **Option C**: Has a dot on the right side.\n- **Option D**: Has a dot on the bottom.\n- **Option E**: Has a dot on the top.\n- **Option F**: Has a dot on the left side.\n\n#### Correct Choice:\nThe missing shape in Row 3 should have a dot on the right side to complete the asymmetrical pattern. Therefore, the correct option is:\n\n\\boxed{C}\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nE",
