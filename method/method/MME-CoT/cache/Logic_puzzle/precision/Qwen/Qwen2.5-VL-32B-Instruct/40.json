    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nAmong the following options, the one that conforms to the change rule of the given graph is ().\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the given graph and identify the pattern or rule governing the changes in the shapes. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Given Graph\nThe graph consists of a 3x3 grid with various shapes in each cell. Each shape appears to have a specific structure involving a combination of geometric elements (e.g., squares, triangles, circles). We need to observe how these shapes change across rows and columns.\n\n#### Rows:\n- **Row 1**: The shapes are:\n  - Top-left: A square house with a small square door.\n  - Top-middle: A triangular roof with a small triangle door.\n  - Top-right: A circular roof with a small circle door.\n  \n- **Row 2**: The shapes are:\n  - Middle-left: A small square.\n  - Middle-middle: A circular roof with a small circle door.\n  - Middle-right: A triangular roof with a small triangle door.\n  \n- **Row 3**: The shapes are:\n  - Bottom-left: A triangular roof with a small triangle door.\n  - Bottom-middle: A square house with a small square door.\n  - Bottom-right: A question mark (?), which we need to determine.\n\n#### Columns:\n- **Column 1**: The shapes are:\n  - Top: A square house with a small square door.\n  - Middle: A small square.\n  - Bottom: A triangular roof with a small triangle door.\n  \n- **Column 2**: The shapes are:\n  - Top: A triangular roof with a small triangle door.\n  - Middle: A circular roof with a small circle door.\n  - Bottom: A square house with a small square door.\n  \n- **Column 3**: The shapes are:\n  - Top: A circular roof with a small circle door.\n  - Middle: A triangular roof with a small triangle door.\n  - Bottom: A question mark (?).\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Pattern\nFrom the analysis, we can observe the following patterns:\n1. **Shape Transformation Across Rows**:\n   - In each row, the shapes seem to cycle through different types of roofs and doors (square, triangle, circle).\n   - For example, Row 1 has square, triangle, and circle; Row 2 has square, circle, and triangle; Row 3 has triangle, square, and ?.\n\n2. **Shape Transformation Across Columns**:\n   - In each column, the shapes also cycle through different types of roofs and doors.\n   - For example, Column 1 has square, square, and triangle; Column 2 has triangle, circle, and square; Column 3 has circle, triangle, and ?.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Missing Shape\nTo find the missing shape in the bottom-right cell (question mark), we need to follow the observed pattern:\n- **Row 3**: The shapes are triangular, square, and ?. Based on the cycling pattern, the next shape should be a circular roof with a small circle door.\n- **Column 3**: The shapes are circular, triangular, and ?. Based on the cycling pattern, the next shape should also be a circular roof with a small circle door.\n\nThus, the missing shape must be a circular roof with a small circle door.\n\n### Step 4: Match with the Options\nNow, let's match the determined shape with the given options:\n- **Option A**: A triangular roof with a small triangle door.\n- **Option B**: A square house with a small square door.\n- **Option C**: A circular roof with a small circle door.\n- **Option D**: A triangular roof with a small triangle door.\n\nThe correct shape is **Option C**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nC",
