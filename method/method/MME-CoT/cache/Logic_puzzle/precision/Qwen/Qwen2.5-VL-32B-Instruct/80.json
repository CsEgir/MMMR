    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nWhich set does the Figure belong to? Select from A, B, and C. (A) Set A (B) Set B (C) Neither set A nor set B\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo determine which set the Figure belongs to, let's analyze the characteristics of Set A and Set B, as well as the Figure itself.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Set A\nSet A consists of shapes that have a horizontal line with a vertical line attached to it. The vertical line can be positioned at various locations along the horizontal line:\n- The vertical line can be at the left end.\n- The vertical line can be in the middle.\n- The vertical line can be at the right end.\n- The vertical line can be offset from the ends or the middle.\n\nExamples from Set A:\n- A \"T\" shape where the vertical line is centered.\n- A shape where the vertical line is at the left end.\n- A shape where the vertical line is at the right end.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Set B\nSet B consists of shapes that have a vertical line with a horizontal line attached to it. The horizontal line can be positioned at various locations along the vertical line:\n- The horizontal line can be at the top.\n- The horizontal line can be in the middle.\n- The horizontal line can be at the bottom.\n- The horizontal line can be offset from the top, middle, or bottom.\n\nExamples from Set B:\n- An \"L\" shape where the horizontal line is at the bottom.\n- A shape where the horizontal line is at the top.\n- A shape where the horizontal line is in the middle.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Figure\nThe Figure shows a shape with a horizontal line and a vertical line attached to it. Specifically:\n- The horizontal line is longer and spans the entire width of the shape.\n- The vertical line is shorter and is attached to the horizontal line near the center.\n\nThis configuration matches the pattern seen in Set A, where the horizontal line is the primary feature with a vertical line attached to it.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Figure to Sets A and B\n- The Figure fits the pattern of Set A, where the horizontal line is the main component with a vertical line attached.\n- The Figure does not fit the pattern of Set B, where the vertical line is the main component with a horizontal line attached.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe Figure belongs to Set A.\n\n\\boxed{A}\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nA",
