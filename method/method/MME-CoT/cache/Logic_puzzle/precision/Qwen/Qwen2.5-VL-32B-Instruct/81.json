    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nWhat diagram replaces the question mark? Select from A, B, C, and D. (A) (B) (C) (D)\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the transformations described in the diagram and apply them step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the given transformations\nThe problem provides four types of transformations:\n1. **Switches the 2nd and 3rd symbols**:\n   - Example: `+IL` → `+LI`\n2. **Switches the 1st and 3rd symbols**:\n   - Example: `+IL` → `LI+`\n3. **Each symbol moves one place to the right**:\n   - Example: `L+I` → `I+L`\n4. **Each symbol moves one place to the left**:\n   - Example: `+IL` → `IL+`\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the given sequence\nWe are given:\n- An unknown starting diagram (`?`)\n- Two transformations represented by green circles (`m m`)\n- The resulting diagram: `✓→↑`\n\n#### Transformation 1 (`m`):\nThe first transformation is represented by the first green circle (`m`). According to the examples, this transformation switches the **2nd and 3rd symbols**.\n\n#### Transformation 2 (`m`):\nThe second transformation is represented by the second green circle (`m`). This is the same transformation as the first one, so it also switches the **2nd and 3rd symbols**.\n\n### Step 3: Work backward from the result\nThe final diagram after both transformations is `✓→↑`. We need to reverse the transformations to find the original diagram.\n\n#### Reverse Transformation 2:\nThe second transformation switched the 2nd and 3rd symbols. To reverse this, we switch them back:\n- Final diagram: `✓→↑`\n- After reversing the 2nd transformation: `✓↑→`\n\n#### Reverse Transformation 1:\nThe first transformation also switched the 2nd and 3rd symbols. To reverse this, we switch them back:\n- Diagram after reversing Transformation 2: `✓↑→`\n- After reversing the 1st transformation: `✓→↑`\n\n### Step 4: Match with the options\nNow, we compare the original diagram `✓→↑` with the given options:\n- **Option A**: `✓↖←`\n- **Option B**: `↖✓→`\n- **Option C**: `→↖✓`\n- **Option D**: `↖→✓`\n\nThe correct match is **Option D**: `↖→✓`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nB",
