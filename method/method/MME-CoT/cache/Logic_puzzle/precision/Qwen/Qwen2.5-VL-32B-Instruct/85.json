    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nWhich of the 4 figures presented (A, B, C, D) is a rotation of the first?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo determine which of the figures (A, B, C, D) is a rotation of the first figure, we need to analyze the positions of the black square and the two black circles in relation to the hexagon.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Original Figure\nThe original figure shows:\n- A black square at the top-left position.\n- Two black circles: one near the bottom-left and one near the bottom-right.\n\n### Step 2: Compare with Each Option\n\n#### Option A:\n- The black square is at the bottom-left.\n- The two black circles are not in the same relative positions as in the original figure.\n- This does not match a rotation of the original figure.\n\n#### Option B:\n- The black square is at the top-left.\n- The two black circles are in different positions compared to the original figure.\n- This does not match a rotation of the original figure.\n\n#### Option C:\n- The black square is at the bottom-left.\n- The two black circles are in different positions compared to the original figure.\n- This does not match a rotation of the original figure.\n\n#### Option D:\n- The black square is at the bottom-right.\n- The two black circles are in positions that match a 90-degree clockwise rotation of the original figure.\n- This matches a rotation of the original figure.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe figure that is a rotation of the original figure is **Option D**.\n\n\\boxed{D}\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nD",
