Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nThe figure filled in at the question mark according to the rule is ().\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of shapes in the given figure. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Observe the sequence\nThe sequence consists of five shapes, with the fifth shape marked as a question mark (?). The shapes are as follows:\n\n1. A black semicircle on the left side of a white circle.\n2. A black semicircle on the top side of a white circle.\n3. A black semicircle on the right side of a white circle.\n4. A black semicircle on the bottom side of a white circle.\n5. The question mark (?) indicates the next shape in the sequence.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the pattern\nThe key observation is that the black semicircle rotates clockwise around the white circle in each subsequent shape:\n- In the first shape, the black semicircle is on the **left**.\n- In the second shape, the black semicircle is on the **top**.\n- In the third shape, the black semicircle is on the **right**.\n- In the fourth shape, the black semicircle is on the **bottom**.\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next position for the black semicircle should be back on the **left** side of the white circle, completing the cycle.\n\n### Step 3: Match the pattern to the options\nNow, let's examine the provided options (A, B, C, D) to find the shape that matches the pattern:\n- **Option A**: Black semicircle on the left side of a white circle.\n- **Option B**: Black semicircle on the top side of a white circle.\n- **Option C**: Black semicircle on the bottom side of a white circle.\n- **Option D**: Black semicircle on the right side of a white circle.\n\nFrom the analysis, the correct shape should have the black semicircle on the **left** side of the white circle, which corresponds to **Option A**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{A}\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nD",
