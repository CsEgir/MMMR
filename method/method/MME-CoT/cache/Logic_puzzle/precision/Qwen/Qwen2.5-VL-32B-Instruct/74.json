    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nYou are given a puzzle. The puzzle consists of a question part on the top and the choices part in the bottom. The question part on the top is a set of visual panels arranged in a 2 by 3 matrix, with the bottom right piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this puzzle, let's analyze the given panels and identify any patterns or rules that govern the arrangement.\n\n### Step 1: Examine the Top Row\nThe top row contains the following shapes:\n1. A **circle**.\n2. A **horizontal ellipse**.\n3. A **zigzag line**.\n\n### Step 2: Examine the Bottom Row\nThe bottom row contains the following shapes (so far):\n1. A **square**.\n2. A **horizontal line segment**.\n3. The missing piece.\n\n### Step 3: Identify Patterns\nWe need to determine the relationship between the shapes in the top row and the corresponding shapes in the bottom row.\n\n#### Pattern Analysis:\n- **Top Left (Circle)** → **Bottom Left (Square)**:\n  - The circle is a closed, rounded shape.\n  - The square is a closed, angular shape.\n  - This suggests a transformation from a rounded shape to an angular shape.\n\n- **Top Middle (Horizontal Ellipse)** → **Bottom Middle (Horizontal Line Segment)**:\n  - The horizontal ellipse is a stretched, rounded shape.\n  - The horizontal line segment is a straight, angular shape.\n  - Again, this suggests a transformation from a rounded shape to an angular shape.\n\n- **Top Right (Zigzag Line)** → **Bottom Right (Missing Piece)**:\n  - The zigzag line is already an angular shape.\n  - Following the pattern, we should look for an angular shape that corresponds to the zigzag line.\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the Choices\nThe choices are:\n1. A **T-shaped figure**.\n2. A **plus sign (+)**.\n3. Another **T-shaped figure** (slightly different orientation).\n4. A **cross with one longer arm**.\n\n#### Applying the Pattern:\n- The zigzag line is angular, so the missing piece should also be angular.\n- Among the choices, all options are angular, but we need to find the one that best fits the sequence.\n\n#### Logical Choice:\n- The plus sign (+) in choice **2** is a simple, symmetrical angular shape that aligns well with the pattern of transforming rounded shapes into angular shapes.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{2}\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\n1",
