    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nYou are given a puzzle. The puzzle consists of a question part on the top and the choices in the bottom. The question part on the top is a set of visual grids arranged in a 3 by 1 sequence, with the last piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Based on a specific pattern, one option in the choice section can be classified into the same group as the question part, while the other three options are categorized into a different group. Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that connects the visual grids in the question part with the choices in the bottom. Let's analyze the given context and choices step by step.\n\n**Context:**\n1. The first grid is a pentagon.\n2. The second grid is a curved shape resembling a smile or a wave.\n3. The third grid is missing.\n\n**Choices:**\n1. A triangle.\n2. A rectangle.\n3. A wavy line.\n4. Two hearts.\n\nFirst, let's look at the relationship between the shapes in the context:\n- The first shape (pentagon) has 5 sides.\n- The second shape (curved) can be thought of as having a continuous curve without any breaks.\n\nNow, let's consider the patterns in the choices:\n- The triangle has 3 sides.\n- The rectangle has 4 straight sides.\n- The wavy line has a continuous curve without breaks.\n- The two hearts have 2 heart shapes.\n\nGiven the pattern observed in the context, the wavy line (choice 3) seems to fit the continuity and curve aspect of the second shape in the context. Therefore, the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part is:\n\n\\boxed{3}\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\n1",
