    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nPlease select the most appropriate one from the four options and fill it in the question mark to make the graph appear regular.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo determine the most appropriate option to make the graph appear regular, we need to analyze the pattern in the given sequence of shapes.\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - The first shape is a square divided into four smaller squares.\n   - The second shape has two diagonals crossing each other inside the square.\n   - The third shape has three diagonals crossing each other inside the square.\n   - The fourth shape has four diagonals crossing each other inside the square.\n\n2. **Analyze the Options:**\n   - Option A: This shape has one diagonal crossing through the center of the square.\n   - Option B: This shape has two diagonals crossing each other inside the square.\n   - Option C: This shape has three diagonals crossing each other inside the square.\n   - Option D: This shape has four diagonals crossing each other inside the square.\n\n3. **Determine the Missing Shape:**\n   - The pattern shows that the number of diagonals increases by one with each subsequent shape.\n   - The fourth shape has four diagonals, so the next shape should have five diagonals.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The missing shape should have five diagonals crossing each other inside the square.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{D}.\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nC",
