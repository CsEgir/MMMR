    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nAccording to the following graph rule, the question mark is filled in with ().\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo determine the correct answer, we need to analyze the pattern in the given sequence of shapes and their corresponding symbols.\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - The first shape is a parallelogram with a diagonal line.\n   - The second shape is a rhombus with a dot inside.\n   - The third shape is a trapezoid with a dot on one side.\n   - The fourth shape is a rectangle with a dot on one side.\n\n2. **Analyze the Symbols:**\n   - The first symbol is an arrow pointing downwards.\n   - The second symbol is a circle with rays extending from it.\n   - The third symbol is an arrow pointing to the right.\n   - The fourth symbol is an arrow pointing upwards.\n\n3. **Determine the Missing Symbol:**\n   - The missing symbol should follow the same pattern as the other symbols.\n   - The previous symbols are an arrow pointing downwards, a circle with rays, an arrow pointing to the right, and an arrow pointing upwards.\n   - The next logical direction would be an arrow pointing to the left.\n\nTherefore, the missing symbol is an arrow pointing to the left.\n\n\\boxed{C}\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nA",
