    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nYou are given a puzzle. The puzzle consists of a question part on the top and the choices in the bottom. The question part on the top is a set of visual grids arranged in a 3 by 3 matrix, with the bottom right piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the pattern or rule that governs the arrangement of the symbols in the 3x3 matrix. Let's examine the given grid:\n\n```\n4 | . | O\n---+---+---\n. | ✓ | 6\n---+---+---\nQ | . | .\n```\n\nThe missing piece is located at the bottom right corner of the grid. We need to determine which symbol (D, W, Y, G) fits best in this position based on the pattern observed in the other parts of the grid.\n\n1. **Horizontal Pattern:**\n   - The first row has the symbols 4, _, O.\n   - The second row has the symbols _, ✓, 6.\n   - The third row has the symbols Q, _, _.\n\n2. **Vertical Pattern:**\n   - The left column has the symbols 4, _, Q.\n   - The middle column has the symbols _, ✓, _.\n   - The right column has the symbols _, 6, _.\n\nFrom the horizontal and vertical patterns, we can infer that each row and column should contain a unique symbol from the set {4, ✓, 6, Q}.\n\nGiven the choices:\n- D\n- W\n- Y\n- G\n\nWe need to find a symbol that does not appear in any of the rows or columns already filled. \n\nLet's check each choice:\n- D appears in the first row.\n- W does not appear in any row or column.\n- Y appears in the third row.\n- G appears in the third column.\n\nSince W does not appear in any row or column, it is the most appropriate choice to fill the missing part.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{W}.\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\n2",
