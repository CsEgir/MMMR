    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nAmong the following options, the one that conforms to the change rule of the given graph is: ().\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo determine which option conforms to the change rule of the given graph, we need to analyze the sequence and identify the pattern. Let's examine the sequence step by step:\n\n1. The first symbol is a circle with a line through it.\n2. The second symbol is an arrow pointing upwards.\n3. The third symbol is a square with a diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right.\n4. The fourth symbol is a lightning bolt.\n\nNow, let's look at the options provided:\n\nA: A circle with a line through it\nB: An arrow pointing upwards\nC: A square with a diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right\nD: A lightning bolt\n\nWe can see that the symbols in the sequence are:\n- Circle with a line through it (first symbol)\n- Arrow pointing upwards (second symbol)\n- Square with a diagonal line from the top left to the bottom right (third symbol)\n- Lightning bolt (fourth symbol)\n\nThe pattern seems to be that each symbol is a different geometric shape or figure. Therefore, the next symbol should be a different geometric shape or figure from the ones already in the sequence.\n\nLooking at the options, none of them match the fourth symbol (lightning bolt). However, if we consider the possibility that the pattern might involve a different type of shape or figure, we can infer that the next symbol could be a different geometric shape or figure.\n\nGiven the options, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{D}\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nC",
