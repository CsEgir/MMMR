    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nAmong the following options, the one that conforms to the change rule of the given graph is ().\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo determine which option conforms to the change rule of the given graph, we need to analyze the pattern in the sequence of shapes. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the pattern in the first row:**\n   - The first shape is a house with a square on top.\n   - The second shape is a house with a triangle on top.\n   - The third shape is a house with a circle on top.\n\n2. **Identify the pattern in the second row:**\n   - The first shape is a house with a square on top.\n   - The second shape is a house with a triangle on top.\n   - The third shape is a house with a circle on top.\n\n3. **Identify the pattern in the third row:**\n   - The first shape is a house with a square on top.\n   - The second shape is a house with a triangle on top.\n   - The third shape is a house with a circle on top.\n\nFrom the analysis, we can see that each row follows the same pattern: a house with a square on top, followed by a house with a triangle on top, and then a house with a circle on top. This pattern repeats for all three rows.\n\nNow, let's look at the options provided:\n- Option A: A house with a square on top, followed by a house with a triangle on top, and then a house with a circle on top.\n- Option B: A house with a square on top, followed by a house with a triangle on top, and then a house with a square on top.\n- Option C: A house with a square on top, followed by a house with a triangle on top, and then a house with a triangle on top.\n- Option D: A house with a square on top, followed by a house with a circle on top, and then a house with a triangle on top.\n\nThe correct option that matches the pattern is Option A.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{A}.\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nC",
