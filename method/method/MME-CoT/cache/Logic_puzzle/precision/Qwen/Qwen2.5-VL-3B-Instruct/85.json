    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nWhich of the 4 figures presented (A, B, C, D) is a rotation of the first?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo determine which figure is a rotation of the first, we need to analyze the orientation and position of each figure relative to the original one.\n\nThe original figure (A) has its black square at the top left corner. Let's examine each option:\n\n- **Option A**: The black square is in the bottom left corner, which is not a rotation of the original.\n- **Option B**: The black square is in the top right corner, which is also not a rotation of the original.\n- **Option C**: The black square is in the bottom right corner, which is not a rotation of the original.\n- **Option D**: The black square is in the top left corner, which is exactly the same as the original figure.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{D}.\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nD",
