    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nFrom the four options given, choose the most suitable one and fill in the question mark to make it show a certain regularity:\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the given sequence of shapes. Let's analyze each row and column to find a consistent rule.\n\n### Row Analysis\n1. **First Row:**\n   - Top-left: Black square on top, white square below.\n   - Top-right: White square on top, black square below.\n   - Bottom-left: Black square on top, white square below.\n   - Bottom-right: White square on top, black square below.\n\n2. **Second Row:**\n   - Top-left: Black square on top, white square below.\n   - Top-right: White square on top, black square below.\n   - Bottom-left: Black square on top, white square below.\n   - Bottom-right: White square on top, black square below.\n\n3. **Third Row:**\n   - Top-left: Black square on top, white square below.\n   - Top-right: White square on top, black square below.\n   - Bottom-left: Black square on top, white square below.\n   - Bottom-right: White square on top, black square below.\n\n### Column Analysis\n- **Column 1 (Top):**\n  - Top-left: Black square.\n  - Top-right: White square.\n  - Bottom-left: Black square.\n  - Bottom-right: White square.\n\n- **Column 2 (Middle):**\n  - Top-left: White square.\n  - Top-right: Black square.\n  - Bottom-left: White square.\n  - Bottom-right: Black square.\n\n- **Column 3 (Bottom):**\n  - Top-left: White square.\n  - Top-right: Black square.\n  - Bottom-left: White square.\n  - Bottom-right: Black square.\n\n### Identifying the Pattern\nFrom the analysis, it appears that:\n- The top-left and bottom-left squares alternate between black and white.\n- The top-right and bottom-right squares also alternate between black and white.\n\nGiven these observations, the shape in the question mark should have:\n- A black square on the top-left.\n- A white square on the top-right.\n- A white square on the bottom-left.\n- A black square on the bottom-right.\n\n### Matching with Options\nLooking at the options provided:\n- **A:** Black square on top, white square below.\n- **B:** Black square on top, white square below.\n- **C:** Black square on top, white square below.\n- **D:** Black square on top, white square below.\n\nThe correct option is **D** because it matches the alternating pattern observed in the rows and columns.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{D}.\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nA",
