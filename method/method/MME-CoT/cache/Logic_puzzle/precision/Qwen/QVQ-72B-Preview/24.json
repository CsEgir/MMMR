Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2.

There's a 3x3 grid of symbols, and one of them is a question mark, which means I need to figure out what should be in that spot. Below the grid, there are four options labeled A, B, C, and D, and I need to choose the one that fits best in the question mark's place.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the pattern or logic behind the symbols in the grid. Let's look at the grid one by one.\n\nStarting from the top left:\n\n1. A triangle on top of two horizontal lines.\n\n2. A diagonal line with a circle in the middle, crossed by another diagonal line.\n\n3. A right triangle combined with a square.\n\n4. A square with a plus sign inside it.\n\n5. A rectangle with a smaller rectangle inside it.\n\n6. Two X's intersecting each other.\n\n7. A house-like shape.\n\n8. A hexagon with a line inside it.\n\n9. A question mark.\n\nLooking at these symbols, it's not immediately clear what the connection is. Maybe there's a pattern based on the number of enclosed areas or something like that.\n\nNow, looking at the options below:\n\nA. A circle divided diagonally into two parts.\n\nB. A square inside another square, both rotated to fit within a circle.\n\nC. A triangle inside a circle, with lines dividing it.\n\nD. A crescent shape inside a circle.\n\nI need to see which of these fits into the grid's pattern.\n\nLet me try to see if there's a repeating pattern or some kind of sequence in the grid.\n\nLooking at the shapes:\n\n- Row 1: Triangle, diagonal lines with a circle, combination of right triangle and square.\n\n- Row 2: Square with plus sign, rectangle with smaller rectangle, two intersecting X's.\n\n- Row 3: House, hexagon with line, question mark.\n\nIt seems like each row has different shapes combined in various ways.\n\nMaybe the pattern is based on the number of straight lines versus curved lines, or the number of enclosed areas.\n\nLet's consider that:\n\n- Triangle (straight lines, one enclosed area)\n\n- Diagonal lines with circle (straight and curved lines, one enclosed area)\n\n- Combination of right triangle and square (straight lines, two enclosed areas)\n\n- Square with plus sign (straight lines, one enclosed area)\n\n- Rectangle with smaller rectangle (straight lines, two enclosed areas)\n\n- Two intersecting X's (straight lines, one enclosed area)\n\n- House (straight and curved lines, one enclosed area)\n\n- Hexagon with line (straight lines, one enclosed area)\n\n- Question mark (curved line, no enclosed area)\n\nHmm, not sure if that helps.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is based on the complexity of the shapes or the number of components.\n\nCounting the number of components:\n\n- Row 1: One shape (triangle), two shapes (diagonal lines and circle), two shapes (right triangle and square)\n\n- Row 2: One shape (square with plus sign), two shapes (rectangle and smaller rectangle), two shapes (two X's)\n\n- Row 3: One shape (house), one shape (hexagon with line), question mark\n\nSo, in rows 1 and 2, the first column has one shape, the second and third columns have two shapes each.\n\nIf that's the pattern, then in row 3, the first column has one shape (house), the second column has one shape (hexagon with line), so the question mark should have two shapes.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. One shape (circle divided diagonally)\n\nB. Two shapes (squares inside circles)\n\nC. One shape (triangle inside circle with lines)\n\nD. One shape (crescent inside circle)\n\nBased on this, option B has two shapes: squares inside a circle.\n\nBut wait, in row 3, the house is one shape, and the hexagon with a line is also one shape, so maybe the question mark should have one shape.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the pattern is different.\n\nLet me look at the shapes in terms of their geometric properties.\n\nLooking at the shapes in the grid:\n\n- Many of them are combinations of basic shapes like triangles, squares, circles, etc.\n\n- Some have lines crossing or intersecting.\n\n- Some have enclosed areas within them.\n\nMaybe the question mark should be a combination of shapes that haven't appeared yet in a similar form.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\nA. Circle divided diagonally: simple division of a circle.\n\nB. Squares inside a circle: nested squares within a circular boundary.\n\nC. Triangle inside a circle with lines: triangle inscribed in a circle with additional lines.\n\nD. Crescent shape inside a circle: a crescent shape within a circle.\n\nLooking back at the grid, we have a hexagon with a line inside it, a house shape, etc., but none of them seem to have a crescent shape or a triangle with lines inside a circle.\n\nOption C seems similar to some of the other shapes in the grid, like the hexagon with a line inside it.\n\nOption D, the crescent inside a circle, might be too similar to the circle with a diagonal division in option A.\n\nOption B, squares inside a circle, is unique among the options.\n\nOption A, circle divided diagonally, is similar to some of the shapes in the grid that have lines crossing them.\n\nGiven that, perhaps option B is the most unique and fits the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the pattern is about combining different basic shapes in new ways.\n\nLooking at the grid, we have combinations of triangles, squares, circles, etc.\n\nOption B combines squares inside a circle, which is a combination of squares and a circle.\n\nIn the grid, we have a square with a plus sign, a rectangle with a smaller rectangle, etc., but not specifically squares inside a circle.\n\nOption C has a triangle inside a circle with additional lines, which is similar to some of the other shapes in the grid that have lines inside them.\n\nOption D has a crescent inside a circle, which is mostly curved lines.\n\nOption A has a circle divided diagonally, which introduces straight lines into a circle.\n\nGiven that, perhaps option B is the best fit because it combines straight-lined shapes (squares) within a curved shape (circle), and this combination hasn't appeared yet in the grid.\n\nMoreover, in the grid, we have shapes that combine different numbers of basic shapes:\n\n- Some have one shape with additions (like square with plus sign)\n\n- Some have two shapes combined (like right triangle and square)\n\n- Some have lines crossing through them (like diagonal lines with circle)\n\nOption B combines multiple squares within a circle, which is a new way of combining shapes.\n\nOption C has a triangle inside a circle with lines, which is similar to having a shape inside another shape with additional lines, which might be too similar to some of the existing shapes in the grid.\n\nOption D has a crescent inside a circle, which is mostly about curved lines and might not fit the pattern of combining different shapes.\n\nOption A has a circle divided diagonally, which is simple and doesn't seem to fit the complexity of some of the other shapes in the grid.\n\nTherefore, based on this analysis, option B seems to be the most suitable choice for the question mark.\n\nSo, the final answer is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nA",
