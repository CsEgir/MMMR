It's a bit confusing at first glance, but I'll try to break it down step by step.\n\nLooking at the top diagram, there's a square with a small square inside it, connected by some symbols to another square that's half black and half white. There's also an arrow pointing down to another square with a small rectangle that's half black and half white.\n\nBelow that, there are two separate diagrams. The first one has a square with a circle inside it, connected to a box with a question mark. The second one has a square with a small circle inside it, connected to a circle.\n\nOn the right side, there are four options labeled A, B, C, and D, each showing different shapes divided into halves, with either both halves the same or different shades.\n\nI think the key here is to understand how the shapes and their fillings are being transformed or combined based on the symbols connecting them.\n\nLet's start by analyzing the top diagram.\n\nThere's a square with a small square inside it, which is connected to a circle with a diagonal cross, then to another circle with a diamond, and finally to a square that's half black and half white.\n\nAdditionally, there's an arrow from the first square to another square below, which contains a small rectangle that's half black and half white.\n\nI need to find out which two proposals from A, B, C, or D complete the bottom two diagrams.\n\nLooking at the bottom-left diagram:\n\n- There's a square with a circle inside it, connected to a circle with a diagonal cross, then to a box with a question mark.\n\n- The circle inside the square might represent some kind of intersection or combination.\n\n- The diagonal cross might indicate some kind of negation or inversion.\n\nLooking at the bottom-right diagram:\n\n- There's a square with a small circle inside it, connected to a circle via a question mark.\n\n- Again, the small circle might represent some kind of relationship or operation.\n\nI think I need to find a pattern or rule that applies to these diagrams and then apply it to the bottom ones to determine which of the options A, B, C, or D fit.\n\nLet's try to see what's happening in the top diagram.\n\n- Starting with a square containing a small square, which is white.\n\n- It connects to a circle with a diagonal cross, then to another circle with a diamond, and finally to a square that's half black and half white.\n\n- There's also an arrow down to another square containing a small rectangle that's half black and half white.\n\nPerhaps the operations represented by the diagonal cross and the diamond are transforming the shape or its filling in some way.\n\nGiven that, I need to apply similar transformations to the shapes in the bottom diagrams and see which of the options A, B, C, or D match the resulting shapes.\n\nLet's focus on the bottom-left diagram:\n\n- Square with a circle inside it connects to a circle with a diagonal cross, then to a box with a question mark.\n\n- Maybe the circle inside the square represents the original shape, and the diagonal cross in the circle represents some transformation.\n\n- Need to determine what shape should be in the box with the question mark.\n\nLooking at the options:\n\n- A: A semicircle divided into black and white halves.\n\n- B: A square divided into black and white halves.\n\n- C: A square with a black vertical stripe.\n\n- D: A circle divided into black and white halves.\n\nPerhaps one of these should fill the box with the question mark.\n\nSimilarly, in the bottom-right diagram:\n\n- Square with a small circle inside it connects to a circle via a question mark.\n\n- Need to determine what should be inside the circle.\n\nAgain, looking at the options:\n\n- A: A semicircle divided into black and white halves.\n\n- B: A square divided into black and white halves.\n\n- C: A square with a black vertical stripe.\n\n- D: A circle divided into black and white halves.\n\nI need to see which of these should fill the circle.\n\nGiven that both bottom diagrams seem to lead to shapes divided into black and white halves, perhaps the rule is that the final shape should be divided into black and white halves, regardless of the starting shape.\n\nIf that's the case, then in the bottom-left diagram, the box with the question mark should contain a shape divided into black and white halves, possibly a square (option B) or a circle (option D).\n\nIn the bottom-right diagram, the circle should be divided into black and white halves, which is option D.\n\nHowever, I need to choose two proposals that complete both diagrams.\n\nIf I choose option D for the bottom-right diagram, then for the bottom-left diagram, option B could be a possible choice.\n\nBut I need to confirm if this is the correct interpretation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps both diagrams should result in the same shape, but that doesn't seem likely from the options.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider the operations more carefully.\n\nLooking back at the top diagram:\n\n- Starting with a white square.\n\n- Applying a diagonal cross operation turns it into something, then a diamond operation turns it into a half-black/half-white square.\n\n- Additionally, there's an arrow down to another square containing a half-black/half-white rectangle.\n\nPerhaps the operations are combining shapes or their fillings in specific ways.\n\nIn the bottom-left diagram:\n\n- Starting with a square containing a circle.\n\n- Applying a diagonal cross to the circle, then to a box with a question mark.\n\nMaybe the box should contain a shape that's the result of applying the diagonal cross operation to the circle.\n\nIf the diagonal cross operation turns the circle into a shape divided into black and white halves, then the box should contain option A or D.\n\nSimilarly, in the bottom-right diagram:\n\n- Starting with a square containing a small circle.\n\n- Applying a question mark operation to a circle.\n\nPerhaps the circle should be divided into black and white halves, which is option D.\n\nSo, if I choose option D for both diagrams, that might be the answer.\n\nBut the question says \"which two of the proposals A, B, C, or D completes the diagrams at the bottom of the page?\"\n\nIf both diagrams are completed by option D, that would be one proposal, but it says \"two proposals.\"\n\nAlternatively, perhaps different options are needed for each diagram.\n\nLet me consider that the bottom-left diagram leads to option B (square divided into black and white halves), and the bottom-right diagram leads to option D (circle divided into black and white halves).\n\nThat would mean choosing options B and D.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the bottom-left diagram leads to option C (square with a black vertical stripe), and the bottom-right diagram leads to option D.\n\nBut option C doesn't seem to fit the description of being divided into black and white halves; it's just a square with a black vertical stripe.\n\nWait, maybe I need to consider that the operations might not result in shapes divided into exactly black and white halves.\n\nPerhaps the operations are combining shapes in different ways.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nLooking at the top diagram:\n\n- There's a square with a small square inside it.\n\n- It connects to a circle with a diagonal cross, then to another circle with a diamond, and finally to a square that's half black and half white.\n\n- Additionally, there's an arrow down to another square containing a small rectangle that's half black and half white.\n\nMaybe the operations are modifying the shapes step by step.\n\nStarting with a square:\n\n- Apply diagonal cross: perhaps invert the colors or something.\n\n- Then apply diamond: perhaps another transformation.\n\n- Result: half-black/half-white square.\n\nSimilarly, in the bottom diagrams, apply the specified operations and see what shape results.\n\nIn the bottom-left diagram:\n\n- Start with a square containing a circle.\n\n- Apply diagonal cross to the circle.\n\n- Result: perhaps a shape that's divided into black and white halves.\n\nIn the bottom-right diagram:\n\n- Start with a square containing a small circle.\n\n- Apply a question mark operation to a circle.\n\n- Result: perhaps a circle divided into black and white halves.\n\nGiven that, options B and D seem plausible.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the operations are combining the shapes in specific ways.\n\nFor example, in the bottom-left diagram:\n\n- Square with a circle inside it.\n\n- Apply diagonal cross to the circle: maybe take the complement or something.\n\n- Result: perhaps a shape that's the opposite of the circle, which could be a square minus the circle, or something else.\n\nThis is getting too vague.\n\nMaybe I should look for symmetry or patterns in the shapes.\n\nIn the top diagram, starting with a square divided into four equal parts, with one part shaded, but no, it's just a square with a small square inside.\n\nWait, perhaps the small shapes inside the squares represent operations or transformations to be applied.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the small shapes indicate what should be filled or shaded.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nLet me consider that the operations are related to the shapes inside the squares.\n\nFor example, in the top diagram:\n\n- Square with a small square inside: perhaps represent the original shape.\n\n- Connect to circle with diagonal cross: apply some operation.\n\n- Connect to circle with diamond: another operation.\n\n- Finally, to a square that's half black and half white.\n\nPerhaps the operations are combining the shapes in a way that results in the final square being divided into black and white halves.\n\nSimilarly, in the bottom diagrams, apply similar operations to get the resulting shapes.\n\nGiven that, perhaps both diagrams should result in shapes divided into black and white halves, which would be options B and D.\n\nBut the question asks for two proposals, and both B and D are options, so perhaps choosing B and D is the answer.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps choosing A and D, since A is a semicircle divided into black and white halves, which is similar to D, a full circle divided into black and white halves.\n\nBut I need to see which ones complete both diagrams.\n\nIf the bottom-left diagram leads to option B and the bottom-right diagram leads to option D, then choosing B and D would make sense.\n\nAlternatively, if both diagrams lead to option D, then only D would be chosen, but the question specifies choosing two proposals.\n\nTherefore, perhaps both B and D are needed to complete the diagrams in a way that makes sense with the operations.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the answer is A and D, considering that A is a semicircle and D is a full circle, both divided into black and white halves.\n\nBut I need to confirm if that's the case.\n\nGiven the complexity of the problem and the limited time, I'll go with the assumption that options B and D are the correct choices to complete both diagrams.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is B and D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B \\text{ and } D} \\]\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nB, D",
