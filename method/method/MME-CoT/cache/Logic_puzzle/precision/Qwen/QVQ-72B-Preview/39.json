There are six boxes arranged in two rows. The top row has three boxes: the first one is a black X shape, the second is a gray diamond, and the third is a gray square with a smaller shape on top. The bottom row has four options labeled A, B, C, and D. Each of these options shows different shapes: A has a curved arrow, B has a sun-like shape, C has arrows pointing in four directions, and D has two rectangular shapes stacked on top of each other. The question is asking which of these four options should fill the question mark in the top row.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the relationship between the shapes in the top row and the options in the bottom row. Maybe there's a pattern or a sequence that I can identify.\n\nLooking at the top row:\n\n1. Black X shape\n\n2. Gray diamond\n\n3. Gray square with a smaller shape on top\n\nAnd then there's a question mark for the fourth box.\n\nIn the bottom row:\n\nA. Curved arrow\n\nB. Sun-like shape with points\n\nC. Crosshair-like shape with arrows in four directions\n\nD. Two rectangular shapes stacked vertically\n\nI need to find which of these shapes logically follows the sequence in the top row.\n\nPerhaps there's a progression in complexity or a change in shape types.\n\nLet me consider the number of sides or the type of shapes.\n\nThe first shape is an X, which is like a star or a four-pointed shape.\n\nThe second is a diamond, which is a quadrilateral with all sides equal.\n\nThe third is a square with an additional shape on top, making it more complex.\n\nSo, the complexity seems to be increasing.\n\nOption A is a curved arrow, which is different from the previous shapes.\n\nOption B is a sun-like shape with multiple points, which could be seen as more complex than the previous shapes.\n\nOption C is a crosshair with arrows, which also has multiple directions.\n\nOption D is two rectangles stacked, which is simpler compared to the third shape in the top row.\n\nMaybe the sequence is about adding more elements or increasing complexity.\n\nIf that's the case, then options B and C seem plausible because they have more elements than the previous shapes.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps there's a different pattern based on the number of points or intersections.\n\nThe X has four points, the diamond has four points, and the square with a shape on top has multiple points if the smaller shape has points.\n\nWait, the third shape is a square with a smaller rectangular box on top, which doesn't necessarily have points unless it's a 3D box, but in 2D it's probably just a rectangle.\n\nSo, the first shape has four points (X), the second has four points (diamond), and the third has four points (square) plus the top of the rectangle, which might be two points, making it six points in total.\n\nSo, maybe the pattern is increasing the number of points.\n\nOption A: curved arrow \u2013 maybe one point.\n\nOption B: sun-like shape with multiple points.\n\nOption C: crosshair with four arrows \u2013 each arrow has one point, so four points.\n\nOption D: two rectangles stacked \u2013 depending on how they're drawn, maybe four points in total.\n\nIf the pattern is increasing the number of points, then option B with multiple points from the sun-like shape would fit.\n\nAlternatively, if it's about adding one more point each time, then option C with four points might fit if the third shape has six points.\n\nWait, but the third shape has a square and a rectangle on top, which together might have more than six points.\n\nI need to clarify the number of points in the third shape.\n\nThe square has four points, and the rectangle on top adds two more points, making it six points in total.\n\nSo, if the sequence is increasing by two points each time:\n\nFirst shape: X with four points\n\nSecond shape: diamond with four points\n\nThird shape: square plus rectangle with six points\n\nThen the next shape should have eight points.\n\nOption B: sun-like shape \u2013 could have multiple points, possibly eight.\n\nOption C: crosshair with four arrows \u2013 each arrow has one point, so four points in total.\n\nOption D: two rectangles stacked \u2013 depending on the drawing, maybe four points.\n\nSo, if option B has eight points, that would fit the pattern.\n\nBut I need to confirm the number of points in option B.\n\nLooking at the image, option B appears to have a circular shape with multiple points radiating outward, similar to a sun.\n\nIf there are eight points, then it fits the pattern.\n\nAlternatively, if the pattern is doubling the points each time:\n\nFirst shape: four points\n\nSecond shape: four points\n\nThird shape: six points \u2013 wait, six isn't double of four.\n\nWait, maybe it's not doubling.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps it's about the number of enclosed areas or something else.\n\nAnother approach: maybe the shapes are being rotated or transformed in some way.\n\nLooking at the shapes:\n\nX -> diamond -> square with rectangle on top.\n\nIt's hard to see a direct transformation.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shapes are being combined in some way.\n\nAnother thought: maybe the shapes are being mirrored or reflected.\n\nFor example, the X is symmetrical both horizontally and vertically, the diamond is symmetrical diagonally, and the square with a rectangle on top is asymmetrical.\n\nSo, perhaps the next shape should be symmetrical in a different way.\n\nBut that seems too vague.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps considering the shapes as building blocks: starting with an X, adding a diamond, then a square with a rectangle.\n\nMaybe the next shape is another combination of these elements.\n\nBut without a clear pattern, it's hard to see.\n\nLet me consider the colors:\n\nFirst shape: black X\n\nSecond shape: gray diamond\n\nThird shape: gray square with a smaller gray rectangle on top\n\nSo, the colors are shifting from black to shades of gray.\n\nOptions:\n\nA: curved arrow \u2013 gray\n\nB: sun-like shape \u2013 gray\n\nC: crosshair with arrows \u2013 gray\n\nD: two rectangles stacked \u2013 gray\n\nSo, color-wise, all options are gray, except the first shape which is black.\n\nPerhaps the question mark should be gray, following the trend of gray shapes.\n\nBut since the first shape is black, and the others are gray, maybe the sequence is about shapes becoming more complex while maintaining a certain color scheme.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the black X is a starting point, and the subsequent shapes are built upon it, changing color to gray.\n\nBut that doesn't directly help in choosing the next shape.\n\nAnother angle: perhaps the shapes represent different geometric concepts or operations.\n\nFor example:\n\nX -> diamond -> square with rectangle on top.\n\nMaybe the operations are:\n\n1. Start with an X\n\n2. Overlay a diamond\n\n3. Overlay a square and a rectangle\n\nThen, the next step would be to overlay another shape.\n\nBut none of the options seem to fit that pattern directly.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps the shapes are being transformed through rotation, reflection, or combination.\n\nLooking back at the options:\n\nA: curved arrow \u2013 could represent rotation or circular motion.\n\nB: sun-like shape \u2013 could represent radiation or multiple points.\n\nC: crosshair with arrows \u2013 could represent direction or intersection.\n\nD: two rectangles stacked \u2013 could represent stacking or layering.\n\nIf I consider the sequence in the top row:\n\nX (symmetry), diamond (another symmetry), square with rectangle (asymmetry).\n\nMaybe the next shape introduces another concept, like direction or movement, which could be represented by the curved arrow in option A.\n\nAlternatively, if the sequence is about increasing complexity, then option B or C would fit, as they are more complex than the previous shapes.\n\nOption D, two rectangles stacked, seems similar in complexity to the third shape in the top row.\n\nOption B, the sun-like shape, is more complex with multiple points.\n\nOption C, the crosshair with arrows, is also more complex with multiple arrows.\n\nOption A, the curved arrow, is less complex compared to the others.\n\nGiven that the third shape in the top row is more complex than the second, perhaps the sequence is about increasing complexity.\n\nIn that case, options B and C are more complex than option D.\n\nOption B has multiple points, similar to the sun, which could be seen as a star with many points.\n\nOption C has arrows pointing in four directions, which is also complex.\n\nOption D has two rectangles stacked, which is simpler.\n\nSo, between B and C, which one fits better?\n\nOption B has a circular shape with multiple points, which could be seen as a continuation of the theme of points or radiating elements.\n\nOption C has arrows pointing in four directions, which is different in nature.\n\nPerhaps the sequence is moving towards shapes with more points or more elements.\n\nIn that case, option B seems to fit well because it has multiple points, similar to the sun, which could be seen as a star with many points.\n\nAdditionally, the sun-like shape could be interpreted as a more elaborate version of the X and diamond shapes, which also have points.\n\nTherefore, option B seems like a logical choice for the question mark.\n\nTo summarize:\n\n- The sequence appears to be increasing in complexity, particularly in the number of points.\n\n- The third shape in the top row has six points (square with four points plus rectangle with two points).\n\n- Option B has multiple points (sun-like shape), likely eight points, which fits the pattern of increasing points.\n\n- Other options don't fit as well in terms of complexity or the number of points.\n\nTherefore, the answer is option B.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{B} \\]\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nA",
