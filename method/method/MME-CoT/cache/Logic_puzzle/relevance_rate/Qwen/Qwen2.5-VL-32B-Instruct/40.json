    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, evaluate the relevance to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) of each step.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Relevancy\nA relevant step is considered as: 75% content of the step must be related to trying to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) to the question. \n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: \nEvaluate relevancy independent of correctness. As long as the step is trying to get to a solution, it is considered relevant. Logical fallacy, knowledge mistake, inconsistent with previous steps, or other mistakes do not affect relevance.\nA logically wrong step can be relevant if the reasoning attempts to address the question.\n\nThe following behaviour is considered as relevant:\ni. The step is planning, summarizing, thinking, verifying, calculating, or confirming an intermediate/final conclusion helpful to get a solution.\nii. The step is summarizing or reflecting on previously reached conclusion relevant to get a solution.\niii. Repeating the information in the question or give the final answer.\niv. A relevant image depiction shoule be in one of following situation: 1. help to obtain a conclusion helpful to solve the question later; 2. help to identify certain patterns in the image later; 3. directly contributes to the answer\nv. Depicting or analyzing the options of the question is also relevant.\nvi. Repeating previous relevant steps are also considered relevant. \n\nThe following behaviour is considered as irrelevant: \ni. Depicting image information that does not related to what is asking in the question.  Example: The question asks how many cars are present in all the images. If the step focuses on other visual elements like the road or building, the step is considered as irrelevant.\nii. Self-thought not related to what the question is asking.\niii. Other information that is tangential for answering the question.\n\n\n# Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"A brief summary of step result\",\n    \"relevant\": \"Yes|No\"\n  }\n]\n\n\n# Output Rules\nDirect JSON output without any other output\nOutput at most 40 steps\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nAmong the following options, the one that conforms to the change rule of the given graph is ().\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the given graph and identify the pattern or rule governing the changes in the shapes. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Given Graph\nThe graph consists of a 3x3 grid with various shapes in each cell. Each shape appears to have a specific structure involving a combination of geometric elements (e.g., squares, triangles, circles). We need to observe how these shapes change across rows and columns.\n\n#### Rows:\n- **Row 1**: The shapes are:\n  - Top-left: A square house with a small square door.\n  - Top-middle: A triangular roof with a small triangle door.\n  - Top-right: A circular roof with a small circle door.\n  \n- **Row 2**: The shapes are:\n  - Middle-left: A small square.\n  - Middle-middle: A circular roof with a small circle door.\n  - Middle-right: A triangular roof with a small triangle door.\n  \n- **Row 3**: The shapes are:\n  - Bottom-left: A triangular roof with a small triangle door.\n  - Bottom-middle: A square house with a small square door.\n  - Bottom-right: A question mark (?), which we need to determine.\n\n#### Columns:\n- **Column 1**: The shapes are:\n  - Top: A square house with a small square door.\n  - Middle: A small square.\n  - Bottom: A triangular roof with a small triangle door.\n  \n- **Column 2**: The shapes are:\n  - Top: A triangular roof with a small triangle door.\n  - Middle: A circular roof with a small circle door.\n  - Bottom: A square house with a small square door.\n  \n- **Column 3**: The shapes are:\n  - Top: A circular roof with a small circle door.\n  - Middle: A triangular roof with a small triangle door.\n  - Bottom: A question mark (?).\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Pattern\nFrom the analysis, we can observe the following patterns:\n1. **Shape Transformation Across Rows**:\n   - In each row, the shapes seem to cycle through different types of roofs and doors (square, triangle, circle).\n   - For example, Row 1 has square, triangle, and circle; Row 2 has square, circle, and triangle; Row 3 has triangle, square, and ?.\n\n2. **Shape Transformation Across Columns**:\n   - In each column, the shapes also cycle through different types of roofs and doors.\n   - For example, Column 1 has square, square, and triangle; Column 2 has triangle, circle, and square; Column 3 has circle, triangle, and ?.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Missing Shape\nTo find the missing shape in the bottom-right cell (question mark), we need to follow the observed pattern:\n- **Row 3**: The shapes are triangular, square, and ?. Based on the cycling pattern, the next shape should be a circular roof with a small circle door.\n- **Column 3**: The shapes are circular, triangular, and ?. Based on the cycling pattern, the next shape should also be a circular roof with a small circle door.\n\nThus, the missing shape must be a circular roof with a small circle door.\n\n### Step 4: Match with the Options\nNow, let's match the determined shape with the given options:\n- **Option A**: A triangular roof with a small triangle door.\n- **Option B**: A square house with a small square door.\n- **Option C**: A circular roof with a small circle door.\n- **Option D**: A triangular roof with a small triangle door.\n\nThe correct shape is **Option C**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\[\n\\boxed{C}\n\\]",
