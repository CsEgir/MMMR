    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, evaluate the relevance to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) of each step.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Relevancy\nA relevant step is considered as: 75% content of the step must be related to trying to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) to the question. \n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: \nEvaluate relevancy independent of correctness. As long as the step is trying to get to a solution, it is considered relevant. Logical fallacy, knowledge mistake, inconsistent with previous steps, or other mistakes do not affect relevance.\nA logically wrong step can be relevant if the reasoning attempts to address the question.\n\nThe following behaviour is considered as relevant:\ni. The step is planning, summarizing, thinking, verifying, calculating, or confirming an intermediate/final conclusion helpful to get a solution.\nii. The step is summarizing or reflecting on previously reached conclusion relevant to get a solution.\niii. Repeating the information in the question or give the final answer.\niv. A relevant image depiction shoule be in one of following situation: 1. help to obtain a conclusion helpful to solve the question later; 2. help to identify certain patterns in the image later; 3. directly contributes to the answer\nv. Depicting or analyzing the options of the question is also relevant.\nvi. Repeating previous relevant steps are also considered relevant. \n\nThe following behaviour is considered as irrelevant: \ni. Depicting image information that does not related to what is asking in the question.  Example: The question asks how many cars are present in all the images. If the step focuses on other visual elements like the road or building, the step is considered as irrelevant.\nii. Self-thought not related to what the question is asking.\niii. Other information that is tangential for answering the question.\n\n\n# Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"A brief summary of step result\",\n    \"relevant\": \"Yes|No\"\n  }\n]\n\n\n# Output Rules\nDirect JSON output without any other output\nOutput at most 40 steps\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nThe mirror only exists when the Self is projected onto it.  Select from A, B and C. (A) True (B)False (C)Insufficient Information\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo analyze the statement \"The mirror only exists when the Self is projected onto it,\" let's carefully examine the provided text and its implications step by step.\n\n### Key Points from the Provided Text:\n1. **All mirrors reflect the Self**: This suggests that mirrors are inherently tied to the concept of the Self. They do not exist independently of the Self but rather serve as a medium for the Self to perceive itself.\n   \n2. **Objects exist as Things-in-themselves**: This implies that there are entities (Things-in-themselves) that exist independently of any projection or perception by the Self.\n\n3. **The Self projects onto Objects**: The Self interacts with the world by projecting onto objects, which means the Self influences how objects are perceived.\n\n4. **The mirror is an Object**: This categorizes the mirror as an object in the world, subject to the rules governing objects.\n\n5. **Only Things-in-themselves exist without a projection from the self**: This indicates that true existence, free from the influence of the Self, is reserved for Things-in-themselves.\n\n### Analysis of the Statement:\n- The statement claims that \"The mirror only exists when the Self is projected onto it.\" This suggests that the mirror's existence is contingent on the Self's interaction with it.\n  \n- From the provided text, we know that the mirror is an Object, and Objects exist as Things-in-themselves. However, the mirror's function (reflecting the Self) is explicitly tied to the Self's projection. Without the Self projecting onto it, the mirror would not fulfill its purpose of reflecting the Self.\n\n- While the mirror as an Object may exist independently as a Thing-in-itself, its role as a reflective surface is entirely dependent on the Self's projection. In this sense, the mirror's *functional existence* (as a tool for self-reflection) is indeed tied to the Self.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the emphasis on the mirror's role in reflecting the Self and the dependency of this function on the Self's projection, the statement is consistent with the provided text. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{A}",
