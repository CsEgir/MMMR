    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, evaluate the relevance to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) of each step.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Relevancy\nA relevant step is considered as: 75% content of the step must be related to trying to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) to the question. \n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: \nEvaluate relevancy independent of correctness. As long as the step is trying to get to a solution, it is considered relevant. Logical fallacy, knowledge mistake, inconsistent with previous steps, or other mistakes do not affect relevance.\nA logically wrong step can be relevant if the reasoning attempts to address the question.\n\nThe following behaviour is considered as relevant:\ni. The step is planning, summarizing, thinking, verifying, calculating, or confirming an intermediate/final conclusion helpful to get a solution.\nii. The step is summarizing or reflecting on previously reached conclusion relevant to get a solution.\niii. Repeating the information in the question or give the final answer.\niv. A relevant image depiction shoule be in one of following situation: 1. help to obtain a conclusion helpful to solve the question later; 2. help to identify certain patterns in the image later; 3. directly contributes to the answer\nv. Depicting or analyzing the options of the question is also relevant.\nvi. Repeating previous relevant steps are also considered relevant. \n\nThe following behaviour is considered as irrelevant: \ni. Depicting image information that does not related to what is asking in the question.  Example: The question asks how many cars are present in all the images. If the step focuses on other visual elements like the road or building, the step is considered as irrelevant.\nii. Self-thought not related to what the question is asking.\niii. Other information that is tangential for answering the question.\n\n\n# Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"A brief summary of step result\",\n    \"relevant\": \"Yes|No\"\n  }\n]\n\n\n# Output Rules\nDirect JSON output without any other output\nOutput at most 40 steps\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\n<image>The image displays an intelligence test question featuring a 3x3 grid with nine boxes, where the 9th box is marked with a question mark (?). Your task is to select the correct shape from eight options (labeled A to H) to fill the 9th box, completing the pattern that links all the shapes together.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this intelligence test question, we need to analyze the patterns in the 3x3 grid and determine the correct shape to fill the 9th box. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Grid\nThe grid is divided into three rows and three columns. Each cell contains two shapes separated by a vertical line. We need to identify any consistent patterns horizontally (across rows) or vertically (down columns).\n\n#### Horizontal Analysis:\n- **Row 1**: \n  - Left column: A small black triangle.\n  - Middle column: A large white pentagon.\n  - Right column: A small gray circle.\n  \n- **Row 2**: \n  - Left column: A small black dot.\n  - Middle column: A large gray diamond.\n  - Right column: A small light gray square.\n  \n- **Row 3**: \n  - Left column: A small black diamond.\n  - Middle column: A large black diamond.\n  - Right column: A small light gray pentagon.\n\n#### Vertical Analysis:\n- **Column 1**: \n  - Top: Small black triangle.\n  - Middle: Small black dot.\n  - Bottom: Small black diamond.\n  \n- **Column 2**: \n  - Top: Large white pentagon.\n  - Middle: Large gray diamond.\n  - Bottom: Large black diamond.\n  \n- **Column 3**: \n  - Top: Small gray circle.\n  - Middle: Small light gray square.\n  - Bottom: Small light gray pentagon.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Patterns\n#### Pattern in Column 1:\n- The shapes in Column 1 are getting smaller in size as we move down:\n  - Triangle → Dot → Diamond.\n\n#### Pattern in Column 2:\n- The shapes in Column 2 are increasing in complexity as we move down:\n  - Pentagon → Diamond → Diamond (but with a different orientation or shading).\n\n#### Pattern in Column 3:\n- The shapes in Column 3 are changing in color and form:\n  - Circle → Square → Pentagon.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Missing Shape\nThe missing shape in the 9th box should follow the established patterns:\n- **Column 3**: The shapes are evolving from a circle to a square to a pentagon. The next logical shape should be a hexagon.\n- **Row 3**: The shapes in Row 3 are becoming more complex. The middle column has a large black diamond, so the right column should have a similarly complex shape.\n\n### Step 4: Match the Options\nNow, let's match these observations with the given options (A to H):\n- **Option H**: Shows a large black diamond on the left and a large white hexagon on the right. This matches the pattern of increasing complexity and the transition to a hexagon.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{H}",
