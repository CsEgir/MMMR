    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, evaluate the relevance to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) of each step.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Relevancy\nA relevant step is considered as: 75% content of the step must be related to trying to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) to the question. \n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: \nEvaluate relevancy independent of correctness. As long as the step is trying to get to a solution, it is considered relevant. Logical fallacy, knowledge mistake, inconsistent with previous steps, or other mistakes do not affect relevance.\nA logically wrong step can be relevant if the reasoning attempts to address the question.\n\nThe following behaviour is considered as relevant:\ni. The step is planning, summarizing, thinking, verifying, calculating, or confirming an intermediate/final conclusion helpful to get a solution.\nii. The step is summarizing or reflecting on previously reached conclusion relevant to get a solution.\niii. Repeating the information in the question or give the final answer.\niv. A relevant image depiction shoule be in one of following situation: 1. help to obtain a conclusion helpful to solve the question later; 2. help to identify certain patterns in the image later; 3. directly contributes to the answer\nv. Depicting or analyzing the options of the question is also relevant.\nvi. Repeating previous relevant steps are also considered relevant. \n\nThe following behaviour is considered as irrelevant: \ni. Depicting image information that does not related to what is asking in the question.  Example: The question asks how many cars are present in all the images. If the step focuses on other visual elements like the road or building, the step is considered as irrelevant.\nii. Self-thought not related to what the question is asking.\niii. Other information that is tangential for answering the question.\n\n\n# Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"A brief summary of step result\",\n    \"relevant\": \"Yes|No\"\n  }\n]\n\n\n# Output Rules\nDirect JSON output without any other output\nOutput at most 40 steps\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nAmong the following options, the one that conforms to the change rule of the given graph is: ().\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of symbols in the top row and then determine which option in the bottom row follows that same rule.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given sequence\nThe sequence in the top row is:\n1. üåä (Wave-like symbol)\n2. A (Letter \"A\")\n3. ‚òØ (Yin-Yang symbol)\n4. ‚òê (Square with a diagonal line)\n5. ‚ö° (Lightning bolt)\n\nWe need to observe how these symbols change from one to the next.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the transformation rule\nLet's examine the changes between consecutive symbols:\n\n- **From üåä to A**: The wave-like symbol transforms into a straight-line structure (the letter \"A\").\n- **From A to ‚òØ**: The straight-line structure transforms into a circular, symmetrical design (the Yin-Yang symbol).\n- **From ‚òØ to ‚òê**: The circular design transforms into a square shape with a diagonal line.\n- **From ‚òê to ‚ö°**: The square shape with a diagonal line transforms into a zigzag pattern (lightning bolt).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the next symbol\nThe sequence appears to follow a pattern where each symbol undergoes a transformation in its structure:\n1. From a wavy, curved shape to a straight-line structure.\n2. From a straight-line structure to a circular, symmetrical design.\n3. From a circular design to a square shape.\n4. From a square shape to a zigzag pattern.\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next symbol should transform from a zigzag pattern into a new structure. Let's analyze the options:\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the options\n- **Option A**: ‚úï (Cross symbol)\n  - This is a simple cross, which does not seem to logically follow the zigzag pattern.\n  \n- **Option B**: ‚ò∞ (Trigram symbol)\n  - This is a trigram, which is a more complex structure but does not directly follow the zigzag pattern.\n  \n- **Option C**: ÂçÅ (Chinese character for \"ten\")\n  - This is a plus sign, which is a simple structure but does not directly follow the zigzag pattern.\n  \n- **Option D**: ‚òê (Square symbol)\n  - This is a square, which could be seen as a simpler, more basic structure following the zigzag pattern.\n\n### Step 5: Choose the most logical option\nThe most logical transformation from a zigzag pattern (‚ö°) would be to a simpler, more basic structure. Among the options, the square (‚òê) fits this description best.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}",
