    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, evaluate the relevance to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) of each step.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Relevancy\nA relevant step is considered as: 75% content of the step must be related to trying to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) to the question. \n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: \nEvaluate relevancy independent of correctness. As long as the step is trying to get to a solution, it is considered relevant. Logical fallacy, knowledge mistake, inconsistent with previous steps, or other mistakes do not affect relevance.\nA logically wrong step can be relevant if the reasoning attempts to address the question.\n\nThe following behaviour is considered as relevant:\ni. The step is planning, summarizing, thinking, verifying, calculating, or confirming an intermediate/final conclusion helpful to get a solution.\nii. The step is summarizing or reflecting on previously reached conclusion relevant to get a solution.\niii. Repeating the information in the question or give the final answer.\niv. A relevant image depiction shoule be in one of following situation: 1. help to obtain a conclusion helpful to solve the question later; 2. help to identify certain patterns in the image later; 3. directly contributes to the answer\nv. Depicting or analyzing the options of the question is also relevant.\nvi. Repeating previous relevant steps are also considered relevant. \n\nThe following behaviour is considered as irrelevant: \ni. Depicting image information that does not related to what is asking in the question.  Example: The question asks how many cars are present in all the images. If the step focuses on other visual elements like the road or building, the step is considered as irrelevant.\nii. Self-thought not related to what the question is asking.\niii. Other information that is tangential for answering the question.\n\n\n# Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"A brief summary of step result\",\n    \"relevant\": \"Yes|No\"\n  }\n]\n\n\n# Output Rules\nDirect JSON output without any other output\nOutput at most 40 steps\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\n<image>The image displays an intelligence test question featuring a 3x3 grid with nine boxes, where the 9th box is marked with a question mark (?). Your task is to select the correct shape from eight options (labeled A to H) to fill the 9th box, completing the pattern that links all the shapes together.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this intelligence test question, we need to identify the pattern that links all the shapes together in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Rows and Columns\nThe grid consists of three rows and three columns. We need to look for patterns horizontally (across rows) and vertically (down columns).\n\n#### Row 1:\n- **Box 1**: Circle with four black dots.\n- **Box 2**: Hexagon with alternating triangles (black and white).\n- **Box 3**: Pentagon with mixed symbols (dots and triangles).\n\n#### Row 2:\n- **Box 4**: Pentagon with small circles.\n- **Box 5**: Diamond with larger circles.\n- **Box 6**: Triangle with smaller triangles.\n\n#### Row 3:\n- **Box 7**: Hexagon with two triangles.\n- **Box 8**: Pentagon with two dots.\n- **Box 9**: Question mark (?).\n\n#### Column 1:\n- **Box 1**: Circle.\n- **Box 4**: Pentagon.\n- **Box 7**: Hexagon.\n\n#### Column 2:\n- **Box 2**: Hexagon.\n- **Box 5**: Diamond.\n- **Box 8**: Pentagon.\n\n#### Column 3:\n- **Box 3**: Pentagon.\n- **Box 6**: Triangle.\n- **Box 9**: Question mark (?).\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Pattern\nFrom the analysis:\n1. **Shapes in Rows**:\n   - Each row contains a different type of polygon (circle, hexagon, pentagon, diamond, triangle).\n   - The shapes in each row seem to follow a specific sequence or transformation.\n\n2. **Symbols Inside Shapes**:\n   - The symbols inside the shapes (dots, triangles, etc.) also follow a pattern. For example:\n     - Row 1: Dots, triangles, mixed symbols.\n     - Row 2: Small circles, larger circles, smaller triangles.\n     - Row 3: Triangles, dots, ?.\n\n3. **Transformation Across Rows**:\n   - The shapes in each column change systematically:\n     - Column 1: Circle → Pentagon → Hexagon.\n     - Column 2: Hexagon → Diamond → Pentagon.\n     - Column 3: Pentagon → Triangle → ?.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Missing Shape\n- **Column 3**:\n  - The shapes in Column 3 are Pentagon → Triangle → ?.\n  - Following the sequence, the next shape should be a square (as the sequence seems to cycle through polygons in a logical order: pentagon, triangle, square).\n\n- **Symbols in Column 3**:\n  - Box 3: Pentagon with mixed symbols.\n  - Box 6: Triangle with smaller triangles.\n  - Box 9: Square with ?.\n  - The symbols in Column 3 appear to be getting simpler: mixed symbols → smaller triangles → simplest form (dots).\n\n### Step 4: Match the Correct Option\nFrom the options (A to H):\n- **Option A**: Square with two dots.\n- **Option B**: Square with two triangles.\n- **Option C**: Square with two stars.\n- **Option D**: Square with mixed symbols.\n- **Option E**: Square with two overlapping circles.\n- **Option F**: Square with two dots.\n- **Option G**: Square with one dot and one circle.\n- **Option H**: Triangle with two dots (incorrect shape).\n\nThe correct shape is a square with two dots, as it fits both the shape progression (pentagon → triangle → square) and the symbol simplification (mixed symbols → triangles → dots).\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{F}",
