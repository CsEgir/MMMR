    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, evaluate the relevance to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) of each step.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Relevancy\nA relevant step is considered as: 75% content of the step must be related to trying to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) to the question. \n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: \nEvaluate relevancy independent of correctness. As long as the step is trying to get to a solution, it is considered relevant. Logical fallacy, knowledge mistake, inconsistent with previous steps, or other mistakes do not affect relevance.\nA logically wrong step can be relevant if the reasoning attempts to address the question.\n\nThe following behaviour is considered as relevant:\ni. The step is planning, summarizing, thinking, verifying, calculating, or confirming an intermediate/final conclusion helpful to get a solution.\nii. The step is summarizing or reflecting on previously reached conclusion relevant to get a solution.\niii. Repeating the information in the question or give the final answer.\niv. A relevant image depiction shoule be in one of following situation: 1. help to obtain a conclusion helpful to solve the question later; 2. help to identify certain patterns in the image later; 3. directly contributes to the answer\nv. Depicting or analyzing the options of the question is also relevant.\nvi. Repeating previous relevant steps are also considered relevant. \n\nThe following behaviour is considered as irrelevant: \ni. Depicting image information that does not related to what is asking in the question.  Example: The question asks how many cars are present in all the images. If the step focuses on other visual elements like the road or building, the step is considered as irrelevant.\nii. Self-thought not related to what the question is asking.\niii. Other information that is tangential for answering the question.\n\n\n# Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"A brief summary of step result\",\n    \"relevant\": \"Yes|No\"\n  }\n]\n\n\n# Output Rules\nDirect JSON output without any other output\nOutput at most 40 steps\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nThe figure filled in at the question mark according to the rule is ().\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of shapes in the given figure. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Observe the sequence\nThe sequence consists of five shapes, with the fifth shape marked as a question mark (?). The shapes are as follows:\n\n1. A black semicircle on the left side of a white circle.\n2. A black semicircle on the top side of a white circle.\n3. A black semicircle on the right side of a white circle.\n4. A black semicircle on the bottom side of a white circle.\n5. The question mark (?) indicates the next shape in the sequence.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the pattern\nThe key observation is that the black semicircle rotates clockwise around the white circle in each subsequent shape:\n- In the first shape, the black semicircle is on the **left**.\n- In the second shape, the black semicircle is on the **top**.\n- In the third shape, the black semicircle is on the **right**.\n- In the fourth shape, the black semicircle is on the **bottom**.\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next position for the black semicircle should be back on the **left** side of the white circle, completing the cycle.\n\n### Step 3: Match the pattern to the options\nNow, let's examine the provided options (A, B, C, D) to find the shape that matches the pattern:\n- **Option A**: Black semicircle on the left side of a white circle.\n- **Option B**: Black semicircle on the top side of a white circle.\n- **Option C**: Black semicircle on the bottom side of a white circle.\n- **Option D**: Black semicircle on the right side of a white circle.\n\nFrom the analysis, the correct shape should have the black semicircle on the **left** side of the white circle, which corresponds to **Option A**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{A}",
