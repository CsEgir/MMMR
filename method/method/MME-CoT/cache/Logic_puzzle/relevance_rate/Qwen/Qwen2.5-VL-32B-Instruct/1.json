    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, evaluate the relevance to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) of each step.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Relevancy\nA relevant step is considered as: 75% content of the step must be related to trying to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) to the question. \n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: \nEvaluate relevancy independent of correctness. As long as the step is trying to get to a solution, it is considered relevant. Logical fallacy, knowledge mistake, inconsistent with previous steps, or other mistakes do not affect relevance.\nA logically wrong step can be relevant if the reasoning attempts to address the question.\n\nThe following behaviour is considered as relevant:\ni. The step is planning, summarizing, thinking, verifying, calculating, or confirming an intermediate/final conclusion helpful to get a solution.\nii. The step is summarizing or reflecting on previously reached conclusion relevant to get a solution.\niii. Repeating the information in the question or give the final answer.\niv. A relevant image depiction shoule be in one of following situation: 1. help to obtain a conclusion helpful to solve the question later; 2. help to identify certain patterns in the image later; 3. directly contributes to the answer\nv. Depicting or analyzing the options of the question is also relevant.\nvi. Repeating previous relevant steps are also considered relevant. \n\nThe following behaviour is considered as irrelevant: \ni. Depicting image information that does not related to what is asking in the question.  Example: The question asks how many cars are present in all the images. If the step focuses on other visual elements like the road or building, the step is considered as irrelevant.\nii. Self-thought not related to what the question is asking.\niii. Other information that is tangential for answering the question.\n\n\n# Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"A brief summary of step result\",\n    \"relevant\": \"Yes|No\"\n  }\n]\n\n\n# Output Rules\nDirect JSON output without any other output\nOutput at most 40 steps\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\n<image>The image displays an intelligence test question in the form of a matrix pattern puzzle. There are eight shapes provided, with one space left blank, indicated by a question mark. The shapes are organized into three rows, each containing three boxes. Your task is to select the correct shape from six options (labeled A to F) to fill the empty box, completing the pattern that links all the shapes together.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this matrix pattern puzzle, we need to analyze the given shapes and identify the underlying pattern. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Rows and Columns\nThe matrix consists of three rows and three columns. We need to determine the relationship between the shapes in each row and column.\n\n#### Row 1:\n- The first shape has two dots at the top corners.\n- The second shape has two dots at the bottom corners.\n- The third shape has two dots on the left and right sides.\n\n#### Row 2:\n- The first shape has one dot on the left side.\n- The second shape has one dot on the top.\n- The third shape has one dot on the right side.\n\n#### Row 3:\n- The first shape has one dot on the bottom.\n- The second shape has one dot on the top.\n- The third shape is missing, indicated by a question mark.\n\n#### Column 1:\n- The first shape has two dots at the top corners.\n- The second shape has one dot on the left side.\n- The third shape has one dot on the bottom.\n\n#### Column 2:\n- The first shape has two dots at the bottom corners.\n- The second shape has one dot on the top.\n- The third shape has one dot on the top.\n\n#### Column 3:\n- The first shape has two dots on the left and right sides.\n- The second shape has one dot on the right side.\n- The third shape is missing.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Pattern\nFrom the analysis:\n- **Row-wise**: Each row seems to follow a consistent pattern of dot placement.\n- **Column-wise**: Each column also follows a consistent pattern of dot placement.\n\n#### Observations:\n1. **Row 1**: The dots are placed symmetrically (top corners, bottom corners, left-right sides).\n2. **Row 2**: The dots are placed asymmetrically (left, top, right).\n3. **Row 3**: The dots are placed asymmetrically (bottom, top, ?).\n\n#### Missing Shape in Row 3:\n- The first shape in Row 3 has a dot on the bottom.\n- The second shape in Row 3 has a dot on the top.\n- The third shape should logically have a dot on the left or right side to complete the asymmetrical pattern.\n\n### Step 3: Match the Options\nNow, let's examine the options (A to F) to find the shape that fits the pattern:\n\n- **Option A**: Has a dot on the left side.\n- **Option B**: Has a dot on the top.\n- **Option C**: Has a dot on the right side.\n- **Option D**: Has a dot on the bottom.\n- **Option E**: Has a dot on the top.\n- **Option F**: Has a dot on the left side.\n\n#### Correct Choice:\nThe missing shape in Row 3 should have a dot on the right side to complete the asymmetrical pattern. Therefore, the correct option is:\n\n\\boxed{C}",
