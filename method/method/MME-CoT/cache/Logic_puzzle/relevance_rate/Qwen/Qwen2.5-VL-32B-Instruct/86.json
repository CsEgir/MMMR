    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, evaluate the relevance to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) of each step.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Relevancy\nA relevant step is considered as: 75% content of the step must be related to trying to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) to the question. \n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: \nEvaluate relevancy independent of correctness. As long as the step is trying to get to a solution, it is considered relevant. Logical fallacy, knowledge mistake, inconsistent with previous steps, or other mistakes do not affect relevance.\nA logically wrong step can be relevant if the reasoning attempts to address the question.\n\nThe following behaviour is considered as relevant:\ni. The step is planning, summarizing, thinking, verifying, calculating, or confirming an intermediate/final conclusion helpful to get a solution.\nii. The step is summarizing or reflecting on previously reached conclusion relevant to get a solution.\niii. Repeating the information in the question or give the final answer.\niv. A relevant image depiction shoule be in one of following situation: 1. help to obtain a conclusion helpful to solve the question later; 2. help to identify certain patterns in the image later; 3. directly contributes to the answer\nv. Depicting or analyzing the options of the question is also relevant.\nvi. Repeating previous relevant steps are also considered relevant. \n\nThe following behaviour is considered as irrelevant: \ni. Depicting image information that does not related to what is asking in the question.  Example: The question asks how many cars are present in all the images. If the step focuses on other visual elements like the road or building, the step is considered as irrelevant.\nii. Self-thought not related to what the question is asking.\niii. Other information that is tangential for answering the question.\n\n\n# Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"A brief summary of step result\",\n    \"relevant\": \"Yes|No\"\n  }\n]\n\n\n# Output Rules\nDirect JSON output without any other output\nOutput at most 40 steps\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nWhich figure is a rotation of the object?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo determine which figure is a rotation of the given object, we need to analyze the positions of the symbols (+, ×, and the circles) relative to each other and the grid lines. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n### Original Object:\n- The black circle is in the top-left quadrant.\n- The white circle is in the bottom-right quadrant.\n- The \"+\" symbol is in the top-right quadrant.\n- The \"×\" symbol is in the bottom-left quadrant.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Relative Positions**: The symbols are arranged symmetrically around the center of the grid.\n2. **Rotation**: A rotation will preserve the relative distances and orientations of the symbols but will change their absolute positions on the grid.\n\n### Analyzing Each Option:\n#### Option A:\n- Black circle: Top-left\n- White circle: Bottom-right\n- \"+\": Top-right\n- \"×\": Bottom-left\n\nThis matches the original object exactly. However, since the question asks for a **rotation**, this option is not a rotated version but rather an identical copy.\n\n#### Option B:\n- Black circle: Top-left\n- White circle: Bottom-right\n- \"+\": Bottom-left\n- \"×\": Top-right\n\nHere, the \"+\" and \"×\" symbols have swapped positions compared to the original. This is not a valid rotation because rotations preserve the relative positions of all elements.\n\n#### Option C:\n- Black circle: Bottom-right\n- White circle: Top-left\n- \"+\": Bottom-left\n- \"×\": Top-right\n\nThis configuration shows a 180-degree rotation of the original object:\n- The black circle moves from top-left to bottom-right.\n- The white circle moves from bottom-right to top-left.\n- The \"+\" moves from top-right to bottom-left.\n- The \"×\" moves from bottom-left to top-right.\n\nAll elements maintain their relative positions but are flipped across both axes, which is consistent with a 180-degree rotation.\n\n#### Option D:\n- Black circle: Bottom-right\n- White circle: Top-left\n- \"+\": Top-right\n- \"×\": Bottom-left\n\nThis configuration does not match any valid rotation of the original object. The symbols are not in positions that would result from a rotation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only option that represents a valid rotation of the original object is **Option C**, which shows a 180-degree rotation.\n\n\\boxed{C}",
