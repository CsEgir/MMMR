    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, evaluate the relevance to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) of each step.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Relevancy\nA relevant step is considered as: 75% content of the step must be related to trying to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) to the question. \n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: \nEvaluate relevancy independent of correctness. As long as the step is trying to get to a solution, it is considered relevant. Logical fallacy, knowledge mistake, inconsistent with previous steps, or other mistakes do not affect relevance.\nA logically wrong step can be relevant if the reasoning attempts to address the question.\n\nThe following behaviour is considered as relevant:\ni. The step is planning, summarizing, thinking, verifying, calculating, or confirming an intermediate/final conclusion helpful to get a solution.\nii. The step is summarizing or reflecting on previously reached conclusion relevant to get a solution.\niii. Repeating the information in the question or give the final answer.\niv. A relevant image depiction shoule be in one of following situation: 1. help to obtain a conclusion helpful to solve the question later; 2. help to identify certain patterns in the image later; 3. directly contributes to the answer\nv. Depicting or analyzing the options of the question is also relevant.\nvi. Repeating previous relevant steps are also considered relevant. \n\nThe following behaviour is considered as irrelevant: \ni. Depicting image information that does not related to what is asking in the question.  Example: The question asks how many cars are present in all the images. If the step focuses on other visual elements like the road or building, the step is considered as irrelevant.\nii. Self-thought not related to what the question is asking.\niii. Other information that is tangential for answering the question.\n\n\n# Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"A brief summary of step result\",\n    \"relevant\": \"Yes|No\"\n  }\n]\n\n\n# Output Rules\nDirect JSON output without any other output\nOutput at most 40 steps\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\n<image>The image displays an intelligence test question featuring a 3x3 grid with nine boxes, where the 9th box is marked with a question mark (?). Your task is to select the correct shape from eight options (labeled A to H) to fill the 9th box, completing the pattern that links all the shapes together.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this intelligence test question, we need to identify the pattern that links the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the grid step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Rows and Columns\nThe grid consists of three rows and three columns. We will look for patterns both horizontally (across rows) and vertically (down columns).\n\n#### Row 1:\n- **Box 1**: A circle with two small circles inside.\n- **Box 2**: A pentagon with one small circle inside.\n- **Box 3**: A triangle with three small shaded triangles inside.\n\n#### Row 2:\n- **Box 4**: A circle with one small star inside.\n- **Box 5**: A pentagon with two small circles inside.\n- **Box 6**: A triangle with four small shaded circles inside.\n\n#### Row 3:\n- **Box 7**: A circle with three small shaded circles inside.\n- **Box 8**: A pentagon with one small dot inside.\n- **Box 9**: The question mark (?), which we need to fill.\n\n#### Column 1:\n- **Box 1**: Circle with two small circles.\n- **Box 4**: Circle with one small star.\n- **Box 7**: Circle with three small shaded circles.\n\n#### Column 2:\n- **Box 2**: Pentagon with one small circle.\n- **Box 5**: Pentagon with two small circles.\n- **Box 8**: Pentagon with one small dot.\n\n#### Column 3:\n- **Box 3**: Triangle with three small shaded triangles.\n- **Box 6**: Triangle with four small shaded circles.\n- **Box 9**: The question mark (?).\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Pattern\nFrom the analysis, we can observe the following patterns:\n\n1. **Shapes in Each Row/Column**:\n   - Each row contains one circle, one pentagon, and one triangle.\n   - Each column also contains one circle, one pentagon, and one triangle.\n\n2. **Number of Inner Shapes**:\n   - In each row, the number of inner shapes increases from left to right.\n     - Row 1: 2 (circle), 1 (pentagon), 3 (triangle).\n     - Row 2: 1 (circle), 2 (pentagon), 4 (triangle).\n     - Row 3: 3 (circle), 1 (pentagon), ? (triangle).\n   - In each column, the number of inner shapes increases from top to bottom.\n     - Column 1: 2 (circle), 1 (circle), 3 (circle).\n     - Column 2: 1 (pentagon), 2 (pentagon), 1 (pentagon).\n     - Column 3: 3 (triangle), 4 (triangle), ? (triangle).\n\n3. **Inner Shape Types**:\n   - The inner shapes in the triangles seem to follow a specific pattern related to shading and arrangement.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Missing Shape\n- From the pattern in the rows and columns, the missing shape in Box 9 (the triangle in Row 3, Column 3) should have **five inner shapes** (since the number of inner shapes increases: 3, 4, 5).\n- Looking at the options (A to H), we need to find a triangle with five inner shapes that fit the observed pattern.\n\n### Step 4: Match the Options\n- **Option G**: A triangle with five small shaded circles inside.\n- This matches the increasing pattern of inner shapes and the shading observed in the previous triangles.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{G}",
