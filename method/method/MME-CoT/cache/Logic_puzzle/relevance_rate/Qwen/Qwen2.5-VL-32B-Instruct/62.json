    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, evaluate the relevance to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) of each step.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Relevancy\nA relevant step is considered as: 75% content of the step must be related to trying to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) to the question. \n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: \nEvaluate relevancy independent of correctness. As long as the step is trying to get to a solution, it is considered relevant. Logical fallacy, knowledge mistake, inconsistent with previous steps, or other mistakes do not affect relevance.\nA logically wrong step can be relevant if the reasoning attempts to address the question.\n\nThe following behaviour is considered as relevant:\ni. The step is planning, summarizing, thinking, verifying, calculating, or confirming an intermediate/final conclusion helpful to get a solution.\nii. The step is summarizing or reflecting on previously reached conclusion relevant to get a solution.\niii. Repeating the information in the question or give the final answer.\niv. A relevant image depiction shoule be in one of following situation: 1. help to obtain a conclusion helpful to solve the question later; 2. help to identify certain patterns in the image later; 3. directly contributes to the answer\nv. Depicting or analyzing the options of the question is also relevant.\nvi. Repeating previous relevant steps are also considered relevant. \n\nThe following behaviour is considered as irrelevant: \ni. Depicting image information that does not related to what is asking in the question.  Example: The question asks how many cars are present in all the images. If the step focuses on other visual elements like the road or building, the step is considered as irrelevant.\nii. Self-thought not related to what the question is asking.\niii. Other information that is tangential for answering the question.\n\n\n# Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"A brief summary of step result\",\n    \"relevant\": \"Yes|No\"\n  }\n]\n\n\n# Output Rules\nDirect JSON output without any other output\nOutput at most 40 steps\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\n<image>The image displays an intelligence test question in the form of a matrix pattern puzzle. There are eight shapes provided, with one space left blank, indicated by a question mark. The shapes are organized into three rows, each containing three boxes. Your task is to select the correct shape from six options (labeled A to F) to fill the empty box, completing the pattern that links all the shapes together.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this matrix pattern puzzle, we need to identify the underlying rules governing the arrangement of shapes and symbols in the grid. Let's analyze the given patterns step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Rows\nThe matrix is divided into three rows, each containing three boxes. We will examine the patterns within each row to identify any consistent rules.\n\n#### **Row 1:**\n- **Box 1:** Contains a single dot (`•`) in the top-left corner.\n- **Box 2:** Contains a star (`*`) in the top-right corner and a triangle (`▲`) in the bottom-left corner.\n- **Box 3:** Contains a triangle (`▲`) in the top-right corner and a lightning bolt (`⚡`) in the bottom-left corner.\n\n**Observation:** \n- The first box has one symbol.\n- The second box introduces a new symbol in the top-right corner.\n- The third box replaces the original symbol in the top-right corner with another symbol while keeping the bottom-left symbol.\n\n#### **Row 2:**\n- **Box 1:** Contains a circle (`○`) in the top-left corner.\n- **Box 2:** Contains a circle (`○`) in the top-left corner, a square (`□`) in the center, and a dot (`•`) in the bottom-right corner.\n- **Box 3:** Contains a circle (`○`) in the top-left corner, a square (`□`) in the center, and a dash (`—`) in the bottom-right corner.\n\n**Observation:** \n- The first box has one symbol.\n- The second box adds a new symbol in the center and another in the bottom-right corner.\n- The third box keeps the top-left and center symbols but replaces the bottom-right symbol.\n\n#### **Row 3:**\n- **Box 1:** Contains a star (`★`) in the top-left corner and a square (`□`) in the bottom-right corner.\n- **Box 2:** Contains a triangle (`△`) in the top-left corner, a square (`□`) in the center, and a circle (`●`) in the bottom-right corner.\n- **Box 3:** (This is the missing box, which we need to determine.)\n\n**Observation:** \n- The first box has two symbols.\n- The second box introduces a new symbol in the center while keeping one symbol in the top-left corner and adding a new symbol in the bottom-right corner.\n- The third box should follow a similar pattern, replacing or modifying symbols based on the established rules.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Pattern\nFrom the analysis of the first two rows, we can infer the following rules:\n1. **Top-left corner:** The symbol in the top-left corner changes from one box to the next within a row.\n2. **Center:** The center position may introduce a new symbol or remain consistent.\n3. **Bottom-right corner:** The symbol in the bottom-right corner changes from one box to the next within a row.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Pattern to Row 3\n- **Box 1 (Row 3):** Star (`★`) in the top-left corner and square (`□`) in the bottom-right corner.\n- **Box 2 (Row 3):** Triangle (`△`) in the top-left corner, square (`□`) in the center, and circle (`●`) in the bottom-right corner.\n- **Box 3 (Row 3):** We need to determine the correct symbol for the top-left, center, and bottom-right corners.\n\n#### **Top-left corner:**\n- In Row 3, the top-left symbol changes from `★` to `△`. Following this pattern, the next symbol should be different from `△`.\n\n#### **Center:**\n- In Row 3, the center symbol is introduced in Box 2 as a square (`□`). This symbol should likely remain consistent in Box 3.\n\n#### **Bottom-right corner:**\n- In Row 3, the bottom-right symbol changes from `□` to `●`. Following this pattern, the next symbol should be different from `●`.\n\n### Step 4: Match the Options\nNow, let's match these observations with the provided options (A to F):\n\n- **Option A:** Contains a star (`★`) in the top-left corner, a star (`★`) in the center, and a square (`□`) in the bottom-right corner.\n- **Option B:** Contains a star (`★`) in the top-left corner, a triangle (`△`) in the center, and a circle (`●`) in the bottom-right corner.\n- **Option C:** Contains a triangle (`△`) in the top-left corner, a star (`★`) in the center, and a circle (`●`) in the bottom-right corner.\n- **Option D:** Contains a triangle (`△`) in the top-left corner, a star (`",
