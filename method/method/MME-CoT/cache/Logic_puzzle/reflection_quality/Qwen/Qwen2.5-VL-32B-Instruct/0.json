    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nThis template is folded into:\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine which of the given options (A, B, C, or D) the template can be folded into, we need to carefully analyze the pattern and orientation of the faces on the template. Let's break this down step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Understand the Template\nThe template is a net of a cube, consisting of six square faces connected in a cross shape. Each face has a specific pattern of dots:\n- The central square has **one dot**.\n- The four surrounding squares each have **three dots** arranged in a triangular pattern.\n- The top-right square has **five dots** arranged in a cross shape.\n\n### Step 2: Identify Key Features\nWhen folding the template into a cube, the following must be considered:\n1. **Adjacency**: Which faces are adjacent to each other in the final cube.\n2. **Orientation**: How the patterns on the faces align when folded.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Options\nWe will examine each option to see if it matches the folding of the template.\n\n#### Option A:\n- The central face with one dot is visible.\n- The face with five dots is not visible, which suggests it might be on the back.\n- The arrangement of the remaining faces does not match the adjacency and orientation of the template.\n\n#### Option B:\n- The central face with one dot is visible.\n- The face with five dots is visible, but its orientation does not match the template.\n- The arrangement of the remaining faces also does not align correctly.\n\n#### Option C:\n- The central face with one dot is visible.\n- The face with five dots is visible, and its orientation matches the template.\n- The arrangement of the remaining faces aligns correctly with the template's adjacency.\n\n#### Option D:\n- The central face with one dot is visible.\n- The face with five dots is visible, but its orientation does not match the template.\n- The arrangement of the remaining faces does not align correctly.\n\n### Step 4: Verify Correctness\nOption C is the only one where:\n1. The face with five dots is correctly oriented.\n2. The adjacency of the faces matches the template.\n3. The overall structure aligns with how the template would fold.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{C}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
