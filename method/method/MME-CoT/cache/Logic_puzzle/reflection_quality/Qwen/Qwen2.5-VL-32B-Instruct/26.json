    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\n<image>The image displays an intelligence test question featuring a 3x3 grid with nine boxes, where the 9th box is marked with a question mark (?). Your task is to select the correct shape from eight options (labeled A to H) to fill the 9th box, completing the pattern that links all the shapes together.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this intelligence test question, we need to identify the pattern that links the shapes in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Observe the grid\nThe grid is divided into three rows and three columns. Each cell contains a shape, and the goal is to determine the missing shape in the bottom-right cell (the 9th box).\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the patterns\n#### Row-wise analysis:\n- **Row 1**: The shapes are circles of decreasing size.\n  - First box: Large black circle.\n  - Second box: Medium gray circle.\n  - Third box: Small white circle.\n\n- **Row 2**: The shapes are hexagons of decreasing size.\n  - First box: Large black hexagon.\n  - Second box: Medium light gray hexagon.\n  - Third box: Small black hexagon.\n\n- **Row 3**: The shapes are squares of decreasing size.\n  - First box: Large light gray square.\n  - Second box: Medium light gray square.\n  - Third box: ? (We need to determine this.)\n\n#### Column-wise analysis:\n- **Column 1**: The shapes are large figures of different types (circle, hexagon, square).\n  - First box: Large black circle.\n  - Second box: Large black hexagon.\n  - Third box: Large light gray square.\n\n- **Column 2**: The shapes are medium-sized figures of different types (circle, hexagon, square).\n  - First box: Medium gray circle.\n  - Second box: Medium light gray hexagon.\n  - Third box: Medium light gray square.\n\n- **Column 3**: The shapes are small figures of different types (circle, hexagon, square).\n  - First box: Small white circle.\n  - Second box: Small black hexagon.\n  - Third box: ? (We need to determine this.)\n\n### Step 3: Identify the missing shape\nFrom the analysis:\n- The shapes in each row decrease in size.\n- The shapes in each column follow a sequence of different types (circle, hexagon, square).\n\nFor the third row (squares):\n- The first square is large.\n- The second square is medium.\n- The third square should be small.\n\nFor the third column (small shapes):\n- The first shape is a small white circle.\n- The second shape is a small black hexagon.\n- The third shape should be a small black square.\n\n### Step 4: Match the options\nThe correct shape must be a small black square. Among the given options:\n- **D** is a small black square.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
