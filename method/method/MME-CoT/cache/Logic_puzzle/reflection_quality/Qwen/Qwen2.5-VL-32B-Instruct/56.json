    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nFrom the four options given, choose the most suitable one and fill in the question mark to make it show a certain regularity:\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or regularity in the sequence of symbols provided. Let's analyze the given symbols step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the sequence\nThe sequence is:\n1. $ \\ominus $\n2. $ \\mp $\n3. $ \\odot $\n4. $ \\pm $\n5. $ \\oplus $\n\nWe need to determine the next symbol in the sequence.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the pattern\nEach symbol in the sequence appears to be a mathematical or logical operator with a specific structure. Let's break down the structure of each symbol:\n\n- **First symbol ($ \\ominus $):** A circle with a minus sign inside.\n- **Second symbol ($ \\mp $):** A minus sign with a vertical line through it.\n- **Third symbol ($ \\odot $):** A circle with a dot inside.\n- **Fourth symbol ($ \\pm $):** A plus sign with a vertical line through it.\n- **Fifth symbol ($ \\oplus $):** A circle with a plus sign inside.\n\n### Step 3: Look for a repeating pattern\nNotice that the symbols alternate between:\n1. Symbols involving circles ($ \\ominus $, $ \\odot $, $ \\oplus $).\n2. Symbols involving lines ($ \\mp $, $ \\pm $).\n\n### Step 4: Determine the next symbol\nThe sequence so far is:\n- Circle-based: $ \\ominus $, $ \\odot $, $ \\oplus $\n- Line-based: $ \\mp $, $ \\pm $\n\nThe next symbol should follow the pattern of alternating between circle-based and line-based symbols. Since the last symbol ($ \\oplus $) is circle-based, the next symbol should be line-based.\n\n### Step 5: Match the pattern with the options\nNow, let's examine the given options:\n- **A:** $ \\square $ (a square)\n- **B:** $ \\div $ (a division sign)\n- **C:** Â¥ (a currency symbol)\n- **D:** $ \\triangle $ (a triangle)\n\nAmong these, the only option that fits the pattern of being line-based is **B: $ \\div $** (a division sign), which is a line-based symbol.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{B}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
