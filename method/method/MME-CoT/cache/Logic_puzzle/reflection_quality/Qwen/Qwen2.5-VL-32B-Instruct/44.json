    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nObjects exist without projection from the Self.  Select from A, B and C. (A) True (B)False (C)Insufficient Information\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo analyze the given text and determine the correct answer, let's break it down step by step:\n\n### Key Points from the Text:\n1. **All mirrors reflect the Self.**\n   - This suggests that mirrors (as symbolic or literal objects) are tools through which the Self perceives or interacts with the world.\n\n2. **Objects exist as Things-in-themselves.**\n   - This implies that objects have an independent existence separate from human perception or projection.\n\n3. **The Self projects onto Objects.**\n   - This indicates that humans impose their subjective interpretations or projections onto external objects.\n\n4. **The mirror is an Object.**\n   - This establishes that mirrors themselves are part of the objective world and are subject to the same principles as other objects.\n\n5. **Only Things-in-themselves exist without a projection from the self.**\n   - This emphasizes that true, unmediated existence (Things-in-themselves) is free from any influence or projection by the Self.\n\n### Analysis of the Statement:\nThe statement in question is:  \n**\"Objects exist without projection from the Self.\"**\n\n- From the text, we know that **Objects exist as Things-in-themselves**, which means they have an independent existence.\n- However, the text also states that **The Self projects onto Objects**, indicating that human perception often distorts or overlays meaning onto objects.\n- The final point clarifies that **only Things-in-themselves exist without a projection from the Self**. This suggests that while objects have an independent existence, our perception of them is often influenced by projection.\n\n### Interpretation:\nThe statement \"Objects exist without projection from the Self\" is partially true because objects do exist independently as Things-in-themselves. However, the text explicitly mentions that the Self projects onto Objects, which means that in practice, our experience of objects is often colored by projection. Therefore, the statement is not entirely accurate unless qualified by the distinction between Things-in-themselves and our perceptions of them.\n\n### Final Answer:\nGiven the nuances in the text, the most accurate choice is:\n\n\\boxed{B}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
