    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\n<image>The image displays an intelligence test question in the form of a matrix pattern puzzle. There are eight shapes provided, with one space left blank, indicated by a question mark. The shapes are organized into three rows, each containing three boxes. Your task is to select the correct shape from six options (labeled A to F) to fill the empty box, completing the pattern that links all the shapes together.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this matrix pattern puzzle, we need to identify the underlying rules governing the arrangement of shapes and symbols in the grid. Let's analyze the given patterns step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Rows\nThe matrix is divided into three rows, each containing three boxes. We will examine the patterns within each row to identify any consistent rules.\n\n#### **Row 1:**\n- **Box 1:** Contains a single dot (`•`) in the top-left corner.\n- **Box 2:** Contains a star (`*`) in the top-right corner and a triangle (`▲`) in the bottom-left corner.\n- **Box 3:** Contains a triangle (`▲`) in the top-right corner and a lightning bolt (`⚡`) in the bottom-left corner.\n\n**Observation:** \n- The first box has one symbol.\n- The second box introduces a new symbol in the top-right corner.\n- The third box replaces the original symbol in the top-right corner with another symbol while keeping the bottom-left symbol.\n\n#### **Row 2:**\n- **Box 1:** Contains a circle (`○`) in the top-left corner.\n- **Box 2:** Contains a circle (`○`) in the top-left corner, a square (`□`) in the center, and a dot (`•`) in the bottom-right corner.\n- **Box 3:** Contains a circle (`○`) in the top-left corner, a square (`□`) in the center, and a dash (`—`) in the bottom-right corner.\n\n**Observation:** \n- The first box has one symbol.\n- The second box adds a new symbol in the center and another in the bottom-right corner.\n- The third box keeps the top-left and center symbols but replaces the bottom-right symbol.\n\n#### **Row 3:**\n- **Box 1:** Contains a star (`★`) in the top-left corner and a square (`□`) in the bottom-right corner.\n- **Box 2:** Contains a triangle (`△`) in the top-left corner, a square (`□`) in the center, and a circle (`●`) in the bottom-right corner.\n- **Box 3:** (This is the missing box, which we need to determine.)\n\n**Observation:** \n- The first box has two symbols.\n- The second box introduces a new symbol in the center while keeping one symbol in the top-left corner and adding a new symbol in the bottom-right corner.\n- The third box should follow a similar pattern, replacing or modifying symbols based on the established rules.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Pattern\nFrom the analysis of the first two rows, we can infer the following rules:\n1. **Top-left corner:** The symbol in the top-left corner changes from one box to the next within a row.\n2. **Center:** The center position may introduce a new symbol or remain consistent.\n3. **Bottom-right corner:** The symbol in the bottom-right corner changes from one box to the next within a row.\n\n### Step 3: Apply the Pattern to Row 3\n- **Box 1 (Row 3):** Star (`★`) in the top-left corner and square (`□`) in the bottom-right corner.\n- **Box 2 (Row 3):** Triangle (`△`) in the top-left corner, square (`□`) in the center, and circle (`●`) in the bottom-right corner.\n- **Box 3 (Row 3):** We need to determine the correct symbol for the top-left, center, and bottom-right corners.\n\n#### **Top-left corner:**\n- In Row 3, the top-left symbol changes from `★` to `△`. Following this pattern, the next symbol should be different from `△`.\n\n#### **Center:**\n- In Row 3, the center symbol is introduced in Box 2 as a square (`□`). This symbol should likely remain consistent in Box 3.\n\n#### **Bottom-right corner:**\n- In Row 3, the bottom-right symbol changes from `□` to `●`. Following this pattern, the next symbol should be different from `●`.\n\n### Step 4: Match the Options\nNow, let's match these observations with the provided options (A to F):\n\n- **Option A:** Contains a star (`★`) in the top-left corner, a star (`★`) in the center, and a square (`□`) in the bottom-right corner.\n- **Option B:** Contains a star (`★`) in the top-left corner, a triangle (`△`) in the center, and a circle (`●`) in the bottom-right corner.\n- **Option C:** Contains a triangle (`△`) in the top-left corner, a star (`★`) in the center, and a circle (`●`) in the bottom-right corner.\n- **Option D:** Contains a triangle (`△`) in the top-left corner, a star (`\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1.
