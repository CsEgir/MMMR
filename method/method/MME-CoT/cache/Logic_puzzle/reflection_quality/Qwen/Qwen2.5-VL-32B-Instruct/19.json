    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nThe figure filled in at the question mark according to the rule is ().\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of shapes in the given figure. Let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Observe the sequence\nThe sequence consists of five shapes, with the fifth shape marked as a question mark (?). The shapes are as follows:\n\n1. A black semicircle on the left side of a white circle.\n2. A black semicircle on the top side of a white circle.\n3. A black semicircle on the right side of a white circle.\n4. A black semicircle on the bottom side of a white circle.\n5. The question mark (?) indicates the next shape in the sequence.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the pattern\nThe key observation is that the black semicircle rotates clockwise around the white circle in each subsequent shape:\n- In the first shape, the black semicircle is on the **left**.\n- In the second shape, the black semicircle is on the **top**.\n- In the third shape, the black semicircle is on the **right**.\n- In the fourth shape, the black semicircle is on the **bottom**.\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next position for the black semicircle should be back on the **left** side of the white circle, completing the cycle.\n\n### Step 3: Match the pattern to the options\nNow, let's examine the provided options (A, B, C, D) to find the shape that matches the pattern:\n- **Option A**: Black semicircle on the left side of a white circle.\n- **Option B**: Black semicircle on the top side of a white circle.\n- **Option C**: Black semicircle on the bottom side of a white circle.\n- **Option D**: Black semicircle on the right side of a white circle.\n\nFrom the analysis, the correct shape should have the black semicircle on the **left** side of the white circle, which corresponds to **Option A**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{A}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
