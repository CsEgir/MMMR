    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\n<image>The image displays an intelligence test question in the form of a matrix pattern puzzle. There are eight shapes provided, with one space left blank, indicated by a question mark. The shapes are organized into three rows, each containing three boxes. Your task is to select the correct shape from six options (labeled A to F) to fill the empty box, completing the pattern that links all the shapes together.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this matrix pattern puzzle, we need to analyze the given shapes and identify the underlying pattern. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Rows and Columns\nThe matrix consists of three rows and three columns. We need to determine the relationship between the shapes in each row and column.\n\n#### Row 1:\n- The first shape has two dots at the top corners.\n- The second shape has two dots at the bottom corners.\n- The third shape has two dots on the left and right sides.\n\n#### Row 2:\n- The first shape has one dot on the left side.\n- The second shape has one dot on the top.\n- The third shape has one dot on the right side.\n\n#### Row 3:\n- The first shape has one dot on the bottom.\n- The second shape has one dot on the top.\n- The third shape is missing, indicated by a question mark.\n\n#### Column 1:\n- The first shape has two dots at the top corners.\n- The second shape has one dot on the left side.\n- The third shape has one dot on the bottom.\n\n#### Column 2:\n- The first shape has two dots at the bottom corners.\n- The second shape has one dot on the top.\n- The third shape has one dot on the top.\n\n#### Column 3:\n- The first shape has two dots on the left and right sides.\n- The second shape has one dot on the right side.\n- The third shape is missing.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Pattern\nFrom the analysis:\n- **Row-wise**: Each row seems to follow a consistent pattern of dot placement.\n- **Column-wise**: Each column also follows a consistent pattern of dot placement.\n\n#### Observations:\n1. **Row 1**: The dots are placed symmetrically (top corners, bottom corners, left-right sides).\n2. **Row 2**: The dots are placed asymmetrically (left, top, right).\n3. **Row 3**: The dots are placed asymmetrically (bottom, top, ?).\n\n#### Missing Shape in Row 3:\n- The first shape in Row 3 has a dot on the bottom.\n- The second shape in Row 3 has a dot on the top.\n- The third shape should logically have a dot on the left or right side to complete the asymmetrical pattern.\n\n### Step 3: Match the Options\nNow, let's examine the options (A to F) to find the shape that fits the pattern:\n\n- **Option A**: Has a dot on the left side.\n- **Option B**: Has a dot on the top.\n- **Option C**: Has a dot on the right side.\n- **Option D**: Has a dot on the bottom.\n- **Option E**: Has a dot on the top.\n- **Option F**: Has a dot on the left side.\n\n#### Correct Choice:\nThe missing shape in Row 3 should have a dot on the right side to complete the asymmetrical pattern. Therefore, the correct option is:\n\n\\boxed{C}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
