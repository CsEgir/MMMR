    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nFrom the four options given, choose the most suitable one and fill in the question mark to make it show a certain regularity:\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of the given grids and then determine which option fits best as the next grid in the sequence.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Given Grids\nThe sequence of grids is as follows:\n\n1. First grid: A single black square in the top-left corner.\n2. Second grid: Two black squares forming a vertical line on the left side.\n3. Third grid: Three black squares forming an \"L\" shape on the left side.\n4. Fourth grid: Four black squares forming a larger \"L\" shape on the left side.\n5. Fifth grid: Five black squares forming a vertical line on the right side.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the Pattern\n- The number of black squares increases by one in each subsequent grid.\n- The position of the black squares seems to follow a specific pattern:\n  - The first four grids show a progression where the black squares are added sequentially to form an \"L\" shape on the left side.\n  - The fifth grid breaks this pattern by shifting the black squares to the right side, forming a vertical line.\n\n### Step 3: Predict the Next Grid\n- The sixth grid should continue the pattern of increasing the number of black squares by one.\n- Since the fifth grid shifted the black squares to the right side, it is reasonable to assume that the sixth grid will continue this shift and add one more black square to the right side.\n\n### Step 4: Match with the Options\nLet's examine the options:\n\n- **Option A**: Six black squares forming a vertical line on the right side.\n- **Option B**: Six black squares forming an \"L\" shape on the left side.\n- **Option C**: Six black squares forming a horizontal line at the bottom.\n- **Option D**: Six black squares forming a diagonal line from the top-left to the bottom-right.\n\nGiven the pattern observed in the sequence, the sixth grid should have six black squares continuing the vertical line on the right side. This matches **Option A**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{A}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
