    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nWhich option from A-E should replace the question mark to follow the pattern present above the separating line? (select from A-E)\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern in the sequence of shapes above the separating line and then determine which option from A-E follows that pattern.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given sequence\nThe sequence above the separating line is as follows:\n1. A square with a diagonal striped pattern containing a solid circle.\n2. A square with a diagonal striped pattern containing a hollow circle.\n3. A square with a diagonal striped pattern containing a partially filled circle (half shaded).\n4. A square with a diagonal striped pattern containing a small solid circle.\n5. A square with a diagonal striped pattern containing a hollow circle.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the pattern\nLet's observe the changes in the circles:\n- The first circle is **solid**.\n- The second circle is **hollow**.\n- The third circle is **partially filled**.\n- The fourth circle is **small and solid**.\n- The fifth circle is **hollow**.\n\nThe pattern appears to alternate between different states of the circle:\n1. Solid\n2. Hollow\n3. Partially filled\n4. Small and solid\n5. Hollow\n\n### Step 3: Determine the next shape\nFollowing the pattern:\n- After a hollow circle (fifth shape), the next shape should be a **solid circle**.\n\n### Step 4: Match the pattern to the options\nNow, let's examine the options A-E:\n- **A**: A square with a diagonal striped pattern containing a solid circle.\n- **B**: A square with a diagonal striped pattern containing a hollow circle.\n- **C**: A square with a diagonal striped pattern containing a partially filled circle.\n- **D**: A square with a diagonal striped pattern containing a small solid circle.\n- **E**: A square with a diagonal striped pattern containing a solid circle.\n\nBoth **A** and **E** contain a solid circle, but since the pattern alternates and the last shape was hollow, the next shape should be solid. Both **A** and **E** fit this description, but typically in such problems, there is only one correct answer. Given the identical nature of **A** and **E**, either could be correct based on the information provided. However, if we assume no redundancy in the options, we can select one.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{A}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
