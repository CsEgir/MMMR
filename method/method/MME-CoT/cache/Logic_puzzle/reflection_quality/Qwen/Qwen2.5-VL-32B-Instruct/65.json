    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\n<image>The image displays an intelligence test question in the form of a matrix pattern puzzle. There are eight shapes provided, with one space left blank, indicated by a question mark. The shapes are organized into three rows, each containing three boxes. Your task is to select the correct shape from six options (labeled A to F) to fill the empty box, completing the pattern that links all the shapes together.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this matrix pattern puzzle, we need to identify the underlying rules governing the arrangement of shapes in the rows and columns. Let's analyze the given matrix step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Rows\nThe matrix has three rows, each containing three boxes. We will examine the patterns within each row.\n\n#### Row 1:\n- Box 1: A vertical line with a purple square on the left.\n- Box 2: A single vertical line.\n- Box 3: A vertical line with a purple square on the right.\n\n#### Row 2:\n- Box 1: A single vertical line.\n- Box 2: Two vertical lines.\n- Box 3: Three vertical lines.\n\n#### Row 3:\n- Box 1: A vertical line with a purple square on the left.\n- Box 2: Two vertical lines.\n- Box 3: (Blank, indicated by a question mark).\n\n### Step 2: Identify Patterns\nFrom the analysis of the rows, we can observe the following patterns:\n\n1. **Vertical Lines**:\n   - Row 1: 1 line → 1 line → 1 line.\n   - Row 2: 1 line → 2 lines → 3 lines.\n   - Row 3: 1 line → 2 lines → ? lines.\n     - The number of vertical lines increases by 1 in each subsequent box within a row.\n\n2. **Purple Squares**:\n   - Row 1: Purple square on the left → No square → Purple square on the right.\n   - Row 2: No square → No square → No square.\n   - Row 3: Purple square on the left → No square → ?\n     - The presence of purple squares alternates between rows and follows a specific side pattern.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Missing Shape\nUsing the observed patterns:\n- In Row 3, the number of vertical lines should increase sequentially: 1 → 2 → 3.\n- The purple square alternates sides and is present in the first box of Row 3. Following this pattern, the third box should have a purple square on the right.\n\nThus, the missing shape should have:\n- 3 vertical lines.\n- A purple square on the right.\n\n### Step 4: Match the Options\nNow, let's match these characteristics with the provided options (A to F):\n- **Option A**: 1 vertical line, purple square on the left.\n- **Option B**: 1 vertical line, no square.\n- **Option C**: 1 vertical line, purple square on the right.\n- **Option D**: 1 vertical line, purple square on the left.\n- **Option E**: 3 vertical lines, no square.\n- **Option F**: 3 vertical lines, purple square on the right.\n\nThe correct shape is **Option F**, which has 3 vertical lines and a purple square on the right.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{F}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
