    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nWhich figure is a rotation of the object? Select from A, B, C, and D. (A) (B) (C) (D)\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine which figure is a rotation of the given object, let's analyze the original shape and compare it to the options provided.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Original Shape\nThe original shape is a 3D object that resembles the letter \"T\" with an additional cube attached to the top-left corner of the vertical bar. Key features:\n- The main structure is a \"T\" shape.\n- There is a black cube attached to the top-left corner of the vertical bar.\n\n### Step 2: Compare with Each Option\nWe will rotate the original shape mentally or visualize its possible orientations to match one of the given options.\n\n#### Option A:\n- The shape in Option A has a similar \"L\" configuration but is oriented differently.\n- The black cube is positioned on the bottom-left side of the vertical bar.\n- This does not match the original shape when rotated.\n\n#### Option B:\n- The shape in Option B has a similar \"L\" configuration.\n- The black cube is positioned on the top-right side of the vertical bar.\n- This matches the original shape if we rotate the original object 90 degrees clockwise around the vertical axis.\n\n#### Option C:\n- The shape in Option C has a different orientation.\n- The black cube is positioned on the bottom-right side of the vertical bar.\n- This does not match the original shape when rotated.\n\n#### Option D:\n- The shape in Option D has a similar \"L\" configuration.\n- The black cube is positioned on the top-left side of the horizontal bar.\n- This does not match the original shape when rotated.\n\n### Step 3: Conclusion\nAfter analyzing all the options, Option B is the only one that can be obtained by rotating the original shape. Specifically, rotating the original shape 90 degrees clockwise around the vertical axis results in the configuration shown in Option B.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{B}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
