    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nWhich figure is a rotation of the object?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine which figure is a rotation of the given object, let's analyze the structure and orientation of the object step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the Original Object\nThe original object is a 3D shape composed of cubes. Key observations:\n- The shape has a vertical column of cubes on the left.\n- There is an additional cube extending horizontally from the second cube in the vertical column.\n- The overall structure resembles an \"L\" shape when viewed from the front.\n\n### Step 2: Examine Each Option\nWe will compare each option (A, B, C, D) to the original object to see if it can be obtained by rotating the original shape.\n\n#### Option A:\n- The shape has a vertical column of cubes on the left.\n- There is an additional cube extending horizontally from the second cube in the vertical column.\n- This matches the original object exactly.\n- **This could be a rotation of the original object.**\n\n#### Option B:\n- The shape has a vertical column of cubes on the left.\n- There is an additional cube extending horizontally from the top cube in the vertical column.\n- This does not match the original object because the horizontal extension is in a different position.\n- **This is not a rotation of the original object.**\n\n#### Option C:\n- The shape has a vertical column of cubes on the right.\n- There is an additional cube extending horizontally from the second cube in the vertical column.\n- This is a mirror image of the original object, not a rotation.\n- **This is not a rotation of the original object.**\n\n#### Option D:\n- The shape has a vertical column of cubes on the right.\n- There is an additional cube extending horizontally from the top cube in the vertical column.\n- This does not match the original object because the horizontal extension is in a different position and the orientation is incorrect.\n- **This is not a rotation of the original object.**\n\n### Step 3: Confirm the Correct Answer\nFrom the analysis, only Option A matches the original object when rotated. The other options either have the horizontal extension in the wrong position or are mirror images.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{A}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
