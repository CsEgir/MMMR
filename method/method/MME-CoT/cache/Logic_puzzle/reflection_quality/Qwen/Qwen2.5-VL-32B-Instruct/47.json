    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nThe mirror only exists when the Self is projected onto it.  Select from A, B and C. (A) True (B)False (C)Insufficient Information\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo analyze the statement \"The mirror only exists when the Self is projected onto it,\" let's carefully examine the provided text and its implications step by step.\n\n### Key Points from the Provided Text:\n1. **All mirrors reflect the Self**: This suggests that mirrors are inherently tied to the concept of the Self. They do not exist independently of the Self but rather serve as a medium for the Self to perceive itself.\n   \n2. **Objects exist as Things-in-themselves**: This implies that there are entities (Things-in-themselves) that exist independently of any projection or perception by the Self.\n\n3. **The Self projects onto Objects**: The Self interacts with the world by projecting onto objects, which means the Self influences how objects are perceived.\n\n4. **The mirror is an Object**: This categorizes the mirror as an object in the world, subject to the rules governing objects.\n\n5. **Only Things-in-themselves exist without a projection from the self**: This indicates that true existence, free from the influence of the Self, is reserved for Things-in-themselves.\n\n### Analysis of the Statement:\n- The statement claims that \"The mirror only exists when the Self is projected onto it.\" This suggests that the mirror's existence is contingent on the Self's interaction with it.\n  \n- From the provided text, we know that the mirror is an Object, and Objects exist as Things-in-themselves. However, the mirror's function (reflecting the Self) is explicitly tied to the Self's projection. Without the Self projecting onto it, the mirror would not fulfill its purpose of reflecting the Self.\n\n- While the mirror as an Object may exist independently as a Thing-in-itself, its role as a reflective surface is entirely dependent on the Self's projection. In this sense, the mirror's *functional existence* (as a tool for self-reflection) is indeed tied to the Self.\n\n### Conclusion:\nGiven the emphasis on the mirror's role in reflecting the Self and the dependency of this function on the Self's projection, the statement is consistent with the provided text. Therefore, the answer is:\n\n\\boxed{A}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
