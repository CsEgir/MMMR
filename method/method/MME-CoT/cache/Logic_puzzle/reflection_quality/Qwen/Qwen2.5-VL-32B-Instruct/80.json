    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nWhich set does the Figure belong to? Select from A, B, and C. (A) Set A (B) Set B (C) Neither set A nor set B\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine which set the Figure belongs to, let's analyze the characteristics of Set A and Set B, as well as the Figure itself.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze Set A\nSet A consists of shapes that have a horizontal line with a vertical line attached to it. The vertical line can be positioned at various locations along the horizontal line:\n- The vertical line can be at the left end.\n- The vertical line can be in the middle.\n- The vertical line can be at the right end.\n- The vertical line can be offset from the ends or the middle.\n\nExamples from Set A:\n- A \"T\" shape where the vertical line is centered.\n- A shape where the vertical line is at the left end.\n- A shape where the vertical line is at the right end.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze Set B\nSet B consists of shapes that have a vertical line with a horizontal line attached to it. The horizontal line can be positioned at various locations along the vertical line:\n- The horizontal line can be at the top.\n- The horizontal line can be in the middle.\n- The horizontal line can be at the bottom.\n- The horizontal line can be offset from the top, middle, or bottom.\n\nExamples from Set B:\n- An \"L\" shape where the horizontal line is at the bottom.\n- A shape where the horizontal line is at the top.\n- A shape where the horizontal line is in the middle.\n\n### Step 3: Analyze the Figure\nThe Figure shows a shape with a horizontal line and a vertical line attached to it. Specifically:\n- The horizontal line is longer and spans the entire width of the shape.\n- The vertical line is shorter and is attached to the horizontal line near the center.\n\nThis configuration matches the pattern seen in Set A, where the horizontal line is the primary feature with a vertical line attached to it.\n\n### Step 4: Compare the Figure to Sets A and B\n- The Figure fits the pattern of Set A, where the horizontal line is the main component with a vertical line attached.\n- The Figure does not fit the pattern of Set B, where the vertical line is the main component with a horizontal line attached.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe Figure belongs to Set A.\n\n\\boxed{A}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
