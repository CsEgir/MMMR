    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nWhat diagram replaces the question mark? Select from A, B, C, and D. (A) (B) (C) (D)\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this problem, we need to analyze the transformations described in the diagram and apply them step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understand the given transformations\nThe problem provides four types of transformations:\n1. **Switches the 2nd and 3rd symbols**:\n   - Example: `+IL` → `+LI`\n2. **Switches the 1st and 3rd symbols**:\n   - Example: `+IL` → `LI+`\n3. **Each symbol moves one place to the right**:\n   - Example: `L+I` → `I+L`\n4. **Each symbol moves one place to the left**:\n   - Example: `+IL` → `IL+`\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the given sequence\nWe are given:\n- An unknown starting diagram (`?`)\n- Two transformations represented by green circles (`m m`)\n- The resulting diagram: `✓→↑`\n\n#### Transformation 1 (`m`):\nThe first transformation is represented by the first green circle (`m`). According to the examples, this transformation switches the **2nd and 3rd symbols**.\n\n#### Transformation 2 (`m`):\nThe second transformation is represented by the second green circle (`m`). This is the same transformation as the first one, so it also switches the **2nd and 3rd symbols**.\n\n### Step 3: Work backward from the result\nThe final diagram after both transformations is `✓→↑`. We need to reverse the transformations to find the original diagram.\n\n#### Reverse Transformation 2:\nThe second transformation switched the 2nd and 3rd symbols. To reverse this, we switch them back:\n- Final diagram: `✓→↑`\n- After reversing the 2nd transformation: `✓↑→`\n\n#### Reverse Transformation 1:\nThe first transformation also switched the 2nd and 3rd symbols. To reverse this, we switch them back:\n- Diagram after reversing Transformation 2: `✓↑→`\n- After reversing the 1st transformation: `✓→↑`\n\n### Step 4: Match with the options\nNow, we compare the original diagram `✓→↑` with the given options:\n- **Option A**: `✓↖←`\n- **Option B**: `↖✓→`\n- **Option C**: `→↖✓`\n- **Option D**: `↖→✓`\n\nThe correct match is **Option D**: `↖→✓`.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
