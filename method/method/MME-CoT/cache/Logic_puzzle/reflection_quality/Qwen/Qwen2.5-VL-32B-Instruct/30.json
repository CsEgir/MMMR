    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nYou are given a puzzle. The puzzle consists of a question part on the top and the choices part in the bottom. The question part on the top is a set of visual panels arranged in a 1 by 5 sequence, with the last piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this puzzle, let's analyze the sequence of shapes in the context part and identify any patterns or rules governing their progression.\n\n### Step 1: Examine the sequence\nThe sequence provided is:\n1. `<`\n2. `⊏`\n3. `▲`\n4. `□`\n\n#### Observations:\n- The shapes appear to be geometric figures with varying orientations.\n- Each shape seems to have a specific transformation or rotation applied to it compared to the previous one.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the pattern\nLet's analyze the transformations step by step:\n\n1. **Shape 1 (`<`)**: This is a left-pointing arrow.\n2. **Shape 2 (`⊏`)**: This appears to be a rotated version of the first shape, possibly a 90-degree clockwise rotation.\n3. **Shape 3 (`▲`)**: This is an upward-pointing triangle. It seems to be another transformation, possibly a further rotation or a change in the type of shape.\n4. **Shape 4 (`□`)**: This is a square. Again, there is a noticeable change in the type of shape.\n\n#### Pattern Hypothesis:\n- The sequence alternates between two types of transformations:\n  1. **Rotation**: Shapes are rotated in a consistent manner (e.g., 90 degrees clockwise).\n  2. **Shape Change**: After a few rotations, the shape type changes (e.g., from an arrow to a triangle to a square).\n\n### Step 3: Predict the next shape\nGiven the sequence:\n- Shape 1 (`<`) → Shape 2 (`⊏`): Rotation.\n- Shape 2 (`⊏`) → Shape 3 (`▲`): Shape change.\n- Shape 3 (`▲`) → Shape 4 (`□`): Shape change.\n- Shape 4 (`□`) → Next shape: Likely a rotation of the square.\n\n#### Rotation of the square:\nIf we rotate the square (`□`) 90 degrees clockwise, it remains a square but may appear differently depending on its orientation. However, since the square is symmetrical, its orientation might not visibly change after a 90-degree rotation.\n\n### Step 4: Match the choices\nNow, let's compare the possible choices with the expected next shape:\n1. Choice 1: `✓` (a checkmark)\n2. Choice 2: `⊓` (a rotated square)\n3. Choice 3: `>` (a right-pointing arrow)\n4. Choice 4: `⊥` (a T-shaped figure)\n\n#### Analysis of choices:\n- Choice 2 (`⊓`) appears to be a rotated version of the square (`□`), which fits the observed pattern of rotation.\n\n### Final Answer:\nThe most appropriate choice to fill the missing part is:\n\\boxed{2}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
