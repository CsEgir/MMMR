    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nWhich of the boxes comes next in the sequence? Select answers from A-E\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine which box comes next in the sequence, let's analyze the pattern step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Identify the sequence\nThe sequence provided is:\n1. A box with a semicircle and a square.\n2. A box with a crescent shape and a square.\n3. A box with a semicircle and a smaller semicircle.\n4. A box with a square and a semicircle.\n5. A box with a crescent shape and a semicircle.\n\n### Step 2: Look for patterns\n#### Pattern 1: Shapes\n- The shapes alternate between **semicircles** and **crescents**.\n  - Semicircle → Crescent → Semicircle → Crescent → Semicircle → ...\n  \n#### Pattern 2: Position of shapes\n- The position of the shapes seems to shift systematically:\n  - In the first box, the semicircle is on the left, and the square is on the right.\n  - In the second box, the crescent is on the left, and the square is on the right.\n  - In the third box, the semicircle is on the left, and the smaller semicircle is on the right.\n  - In the fourth box, the square is on the left, and the semicircle is on the right.\n  - In the fifth box, the crescent is on the left, and the semicircle is on the right.\n\n#### Pattern 3: Additional elements\n- There is a consistent presence of a **square** or a **semicircle** in each box, alternating their positions relative to the main shape.\n\n### Step 3: Predict the next box\n- The last box (fifth box) has a crescent on the left and a semicircle on the right.\n- Following the alternating pattern of shapes:\n  - After a crescent, the next shape should be a **semicircle**.\n- Following the alternating pattern of positions:\n  - After a crescent on the left and a semicircle on the right, the next box should have the semicircle on the left and another shape on the right.\n\n### Step 4: Match the options\nNow, let's match the predicted pattern with the given options (A-E):\n- **Option A**: Semicircle on the left and a square on the right.\n- **Option B**: Square on the left and a crescent on the right.\n- **Option C**: Semicircle on the left and a larger semicircle on the right.\n- **Option D**: Square on the left and a crescent on the right.\n- **Option E**: Crescent on the left and squares on the right.\n\nFrom the analysis:\n- The next shape should be a **semicircle**.\n- The semicircle should be on the **left**.\n- The shape on the right should be a **square** (as it alternates with the semicircle).\n\nThus, the correct option is **A**.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{A}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
