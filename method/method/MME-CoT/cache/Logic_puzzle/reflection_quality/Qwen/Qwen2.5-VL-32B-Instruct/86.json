    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nWhich figure is a rotation of the object?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine which figure is a rotation of the given object, we need to analyze the positions of the symbols (+, ×, and the circles) relative to each other and the grid lines. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n### Original Object:\n- The black circle is in the top-left quadrant.\n- The white circle is in the bottom-right quadrant.\n- The \"+\" symbol is in the top-right quadrant.\n- The \"×\" symbol is in the bottom-left quadrant.\n\n### Key Observations:\n1. **Relative Positions**: The symbols are arranged symmetrically around the center of the grid.\n2. **Rotation**: A rotation will preserve the relative distances and orientations of the symbols but will change their absolute positions on the grid.\n\n### Analyzing Each Option:\n#### Option A:\n- Black circle: Top-left\n- White circle: Bottom-right\n- \"+\": Top-right\n- \"×\": Bottom-left\n\nThis matches the original object exactly. However, since the question asks for a **rotation**, this option is not a rotated version but rather an identical copy.\n\n#### Option B:\n- Black circle: Top-left\n- White circle: Bottom-right\n- \"+\": Bottom-left\n- \"×\": Top-right\n\nHere, the \"+\" and \"×\" symbols have swapped positions compared to the original. This is not a valid rotation because rotations preserve the relative positions of all elements.\n\n#### Option C:\n- Black circle: Bottom-right\n- White circle: Top-left\n- \"+\": Bottom-left\n- \"×\": Top-right\n\nThis configuration shows a 180-degree rotation of the original object:\n- The black circle moves from top-left to bottom-right.\n- The white circle moves from bottom-right to top-left.\n- The \"+\" moves from top-right to bottom-left.\n- The \"×\" moves from bottom-left to top-right.\n\nAll elements maintain their relative positions but are flipped across both axes, which is consistent with a 180-degree rotation.\n\n#### Option D:\n- Black circle: Bottom-right\n- White circle: Top-left\n- \"+\": Top-right\n- \"×\": Bottom-left\n\nThis configuration does not match any valid rotation of the original object. The symbols are not in positions that would result from a rotation.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe only option that represents a valid rotation of the original object is **Option C**, which shows a 180-degree rotation.\n\n\\boxed{C}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
