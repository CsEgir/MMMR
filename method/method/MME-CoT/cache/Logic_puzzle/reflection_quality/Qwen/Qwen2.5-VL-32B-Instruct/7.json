    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nAmong the following options, the one that conforms to the change rule of the given graph is: ().\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the sequence of symbols in the top row and then determine which option in the bottom row follows that same rule.\n\n### Step 1: Analyze the given sequence\nThe sequence in the top row is:\n1. üåä (Wave-like symbol)\n2. A (Letter \"A\")\n3. ‚òØ (Yin-Yang symbol)\n4. ‚òê (Square with a diagonal line)\n5. ‚ö° (Lightning bolt)\n\nWe need to observe how these symbols change from one to the next.\n\n### Step 2: Identify the transformation rule\nLet's examine the changes between consecutive symbols:\n\n- **From üåä to A**: The wave-like symbol transforms into a straight-line structure (the letter \"A\").\n- **From A to ‚òØ**: The straight-line structure transforms into a circular, symmetrical design (the Yin-Yang symbol).\n- **From ‚òØ to ‚òê**: The circular design transforms into a square shape with a diagonal line.\n- **From ‚òê to ‚ö°**: The square shape with a diagonal line transforms into a zigzag pattern (lightning bolt).\n\n### Step 3: Determine the next symbol\nThe sequence appears to follow a pattern where each symbol undergoes a transformation in its structure:\n1. From a wavy, curved shape to a straight-line structure.\n2. From a straight-line structure to a circular, symmetrical design.\n3. From a circular design to a square shape.\n4. From a square shape to a zigzag pattern.\n\nFollowing this pattern, the next symbol should transform from a zigzag pattern into a new structure. Let's analyze the options:\n\n### Step 4: Evaluate the options\n- **Option A**: ‚úï (Cross symbol)\n  - This is a simple cross, which does not seem to logically follow the zigzag pattern.\n  \n- **Option B**: ‚ò∞ (Trigram symbol)\n  - This is a trigram, which is a more complex structure but does not directly follow the zigzag pattern.\n  \n- **Option C**: ÂçÅ (Chinese character for \"ten\")\n  - This is a plus sign, which is a simple structure but does not directly follow the zigzag pattern.\n  \n- **Option D**: ‚òê (Square symbol)\n  - This is a square, which could be seen as a simpler, more basic structure following the zigzag pattern.\n\n### Step 5: Choose the most logical option\nThe most logical transformation from a zigzag pattern (‚ö°) would be to a simpler, more basic structure. Among the options, the square (‚òê) fits this description best.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{D}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
