    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nYou are given a puzzle. The puzzle consists of a question part on the top and the choices in the bottom. The question part on the top is a set of visual grids arranged in a 3 by 3 matrix, with the bottom right piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern or rule governing the arrangement of symbols in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the grid step by step:\n\n### Step 1: Examine the Rows and Columns\nThe grid is as follows:\n```\n| 4 | ⌂ | ○ |\n| ← | ✓ | 6 |\n| Q | b-d | ? |\n```\n\n#### Row 1:\n- Symbols: `4`, `⌂` (partial circle), `○` (full circle)\n- Pattern: The shapes progress from a partial shape (`4`) to a more complete shape (`⌂`), and finally to a fully closed shape (`○`).\n\n#### Row 2:\n- Symbols: `←` (arrow), `✓` (checkmark), `6`\n- Pattern: The symbols seem to follow a progression based on complexity or structure:\n  - `←`: A simple arrow.\n  - `✓`: A slightly more complex shape.\n  - `6`: A more complex numerical symbol.\n\n#### Row 3:\n- Symbols: `Q`, `b-d` (two connected lines), `?`\n- Pattern: The shapes appear to be simpler geometric forms:\n  - `Q`: A letter with a curved tail.\n  - `b-d`: Two horizontal lines connected by a vertical line.\n  - The missing symbol should follow this simplicity trend.\n\n### Step 2: Analyze the Choices\nThe choices are:\n1. `D`\n2. `W`\n3. `Y`\n4. `G`\n\n#### Observations:\n- All choices are letters.\n- We need to determine which letter fits the simplicity trend observed in Row 3.\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Missing Symbol\nFrom the analysis:\n- Row 3 shows a decreasing complexity in shapes: `Q` → `b-d`.\n- The missing symbol should be the simplest geometric form among the choices.\n\n#### Evaluating the Choices:\n1. `D`: A relatively simple letter with straight lines.\n2. `W`: A more complex letter with multiple diagonal lines.\n3. `Y`: A moderately complex letter with diagonal lines.\n4. `G`: A relatively simple letter but has a loop, making it slightly more complex than `D`.\n\nAmong the choices, `D` is the simplest geometrically, fitting the trend of decreasing complexity in Row 3.\n\n### Final Answer:\n\\boxed{1}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
    "valid_outputs": "```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"The solution correctly identifies the pattern of decreasing complexity in Row 3 and selects 'D' as the simplest geometric form among the choices.\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A\"\n  }\n]\n```",
