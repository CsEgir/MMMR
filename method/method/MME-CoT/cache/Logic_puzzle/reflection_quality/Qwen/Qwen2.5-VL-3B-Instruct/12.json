    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nFrom the four options given, choose the most suitable one and fill in the question mark to make it show a certain regularity.（）\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that governs the arrangement of shapes in the given grid. Let's analyze the patterns step by step:\n\n1. **First Row:**\n   - Top-left: A black square on a white background.\n   - Top-right: A black square on a white background.\n   - Bottom-left: Two white squares on a black background.\n   - Bottom-right: A black square on a white background.\n\n2. **Second Row:**\n   - Top-left: A black square on a white background.\n   - Top-right: A black square on a white background.\n   - Bottom-left: Two white squares on a black background.\n   - Bottom-right: A black square on a white background.\n\n3. **Third Row:**\n   - Top-left: Two white squares on a black background.\n   - Top-right: A black square on a white background.\n   - Bottom-left: A black square on a white background.\n   - Bottom-right: A black square on a white background.\n\nFrom the above observations, it appears that the bottom-right square is consistently a black square on a white background. This suggests that the pattern might be focusing on the color and position of the bottom-right square.\n\nGiven this pattern, let's look at the options provided:\n\n- **A:** Two black squares on a white background.\n- **B:** Two white squares on a black background.\n- **C:** A black square on a white background.\n- **D:** A black square on a white background.\n\nSince the pattern indicates that the bottom-right square should be a black square on a white background, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{C}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
    "valid_outputs": "```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"The bottom-right square should be a black square on a white background.\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A\"\n  }\n]\n```",
