    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nAmong the following options, the one that conforms to the change rule of the given graph is ().\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine which option conforms to the change rule of the given graph, we need to analyze the pattern in the sequence of shapes. Let's break it down step by step.\n\n1. **Identify the pattern in the first row:**\n   - The first shape is a house with a square on top.\n   - The second shape is a house with a triangle on top.\n   - The third shape is a house with a circle on top.\n\n2. **Identify the pattern in the second row:**\n   - The first shape is a house with a square on top.\n   - The second shape is a house with a triangle on top.\n   - The third shape is a house with a circle on top.\n\n3. **Identify the pattern in the third row:**\n   - The first shape is a house with a square on top.\n   - The second shape is a house with a triangle on top.\n   - The third shape is a house with a circle on top.\n\nFrom the analysis, we can see that each row follows the same pattern: a house with a square on top, followed by a house with a triangle on top, and then a house with a circle on top. This pattern repeats for all three rows.\n\nNow, let's look at the options provided:\n- Option A: A house with a square on top, followed by a house with a triangle on top, and then a house with a circle on top.\n- Option B: A house with a square on top, followed by a house with a triangle on top, and then a house with a square on top.\n- Option C: A house with a square on top, followed by a house with a triangle on top, and then a house with a triangle on top.\n- Option D: A house with a square on top, followed by a house with a circle on top, and then a house with a triangle on top.\n\nThe correct option that matches the pattern is Option A.\n\nTherefore, the answer is \\boxed{A}.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
