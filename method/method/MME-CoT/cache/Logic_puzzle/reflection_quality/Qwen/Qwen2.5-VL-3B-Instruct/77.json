    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nIdentify the pattern and work out which one of the suggested images would complete the sequence. Select answers from A-D\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this pattern recognition problem, let's analyze the sequence of shapes and their attributes:\n\n1. **Shape**: The shape is a blue square.\n2. **Color**: The color is blue.\n3. **Position**: The position is in the top left corner.\n4. **Orientation**: The orientation is rotated 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nNow, let's look at the options provided:\n\nA. A blue square with a black triangle in the bottom left corner.\nB. A blue square with a dot in the center.\nC. A blue square with a dot in the bottom right corner.\nD. A blue square with a dot in the bottom left corner.\n\nThe correct answer should maintain the same characteristics as the first two images:\n- Shape: Blue square\n- Color: Blue\n- Position: Top left corner\n- Orientation: Rotated 90 degrees clockwise\n\nLooking at the options, only option B fits all these criteria.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{B}.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
