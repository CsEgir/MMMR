    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nYou are given a puzzle. The puzzle consists of a question part on the top and the choices in the bottom. The question part on the top is a set of visual grids arranged in a 3 by 3 matrix, with the bottom right piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the pattern or rule that governs the arrangement of shapes in the 3x3 matrix. Let's examine the given context and choices step by step.\n\n### Context Analysis:\n1. **Top Row:**\n   - First column: Square\n   - Second column: Pentagon\n   - Third column: Triangle\n\n2. **Middle Row:**\n   - First column: Trapezoid\n   - Second column: Diamond\n   - Third column: Hexagon\n\n3. **Bottom Row:**\n   - First column: Triangle (with a dot inside)\n   - Second column: Diamond (with a dot inside)\n   - Third column: Square (with a dot inside)\n\n### Choices:\n1. **Choice 1:** A shape with two dots inside.\n2. **Choice 2:** A shape with one dot inside.\n3. **Choice 3:** A shape with no dots inside.\n4. **Choice 4:** A shape with three dots inside.\n\n### Pattern Identification:\n- The bottom right piece is missing, and it should be placed in the third column of the bottom row.\n- Observing the pattern, each shape in the bottom row has a dot inside it.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe most appropriate answer to fill the missing part is Choice 2, which is a shape with one dot inside.\n\n\\boxed{2}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
