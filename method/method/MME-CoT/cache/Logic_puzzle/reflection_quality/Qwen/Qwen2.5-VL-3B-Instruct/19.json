    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nThe figure filled in at the question mark according to the rule is ().\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine the correct answer, we need to identify the pattern or rule that governs the sequence of shapes. Let's analyze the given sequence:\n\n1. The first shape is a half-circle with a vertical line through it.\n2. The second shape is the same as the first, but rotated 90 degrees clockwise.\n3. The third shape is the same as the second, but rotated another 90 degrees clockwise.\n\nFollowing this pattern, the fourth shape should be the same as the third, but rotated one more 90 degrees clockwise. This means the fourth shape should be a half-circle with a vertical line through it, but rotated 270 degrees clockwise (or 90 degrees counterclockwise).\n\nLooking at the options provided:\n- A: A half-circle with a vertical line through it, but rotated 270 degrees clockwise.\n- B: A half-circle with a vertical line through it, but rotated 90 degrees clockwise.\n- C: A half-circle with a vertical line through it, but rotated 90 degrees counterclockwise.\n- D: A half-circle with a vertical line through it, but rotated 270 degrees counterclockwise.\n\nThe correct option is A, which represents a half-circle with a vertical line through it, but rotated 270 degrees clockwise.\n\n\\boxed{A}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
