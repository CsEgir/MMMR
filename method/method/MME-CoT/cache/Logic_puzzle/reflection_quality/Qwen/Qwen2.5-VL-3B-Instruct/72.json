    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\n<image>The image displays an intelligence test question featuring a 3x3 grid with nine boxes, where the 9th box is marked with a question mark (?). Your task is to select the correct shape from eight options (labeled A to H) to fill the 9th box, completing the pattern that links all the shapes together.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern that links all the shapes together in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze each row and column:\n\n1. **First Row**: The shapes are squares (□), circles (○), and pentagons (△).\n2. **Second Row**: The shapes are diamonds (♦), circles (○), and triangles (△).\n3. **Third Row**: The shapes are pentagons (△), hexagons (hexagon), and octagons (octagon).\n\nLooking at the first row, we see a sequence of squares, circles, and pentagons. In the second row, the sequence is diamonds, circles, and triangles. Finally, in the third row, the sequence is pentagons, hexagons, and octagons.\n\nThe pattern seems to be alternating between different types of shapes. Specifically, it appears that the shapes are moving from one type to another in a specific order: square → circle → pentagon → diamond → circle → triangle → pentagon → hexagon → octagon.\n\nGiven this pattern, the next shape after the octagon should be a square. Therefore, the correct shape to fill the question mark (? ) is a square (□).\n\nThus, the final answer is \\boxed{A}.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1.
