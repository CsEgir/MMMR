    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nChoose the most reasonable answer based on the existing rules of the given graph.（）\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern or rule that connects the characters in the top row with those in the bottom row. Let's analyze each character:\n\n1. **干 (gan)**: This character is a radical for \"water\" and can be associated with water-related concepts.\n2. **固 (gu)**: This character is a radical for \"solid\" and can be associated with solid objects.\n3. **甘 (gan)**: This character is a radical for \"sweet\" and can be associated with sweet tastes.\n4. **凹 (chuang)**: This character is a radical for \"concave\" and can be associated with shapes that are concave.\n5. **口 (kou)**: This character is a radical for \"mouth\" and can be associated with mouth-related actions.\n\nNow, let's look at the bottom row:\n- **神 (shen)**: This character is related to \"spirit\" or \"divine\".\n- **十 (shi)**: This character is a number and can be associated with counting or numbers.\n- **上 (shang)**: This character is related to \"up\" or \"above\".\n- **省 (xing)**: This character is related to \"province\" or \"province\".\n\nGiven these associations, we need to find a character that fits the pattern of being related to something similar to the radicals in the top row. The most reasonable answer would be one that relates to a concept that is common across all the radicals in the top row.\n\nThe character **省 (xing)** in the bottom row is related to \"province\", which could be considered as a general concept that encompasses various aspects like geography, administration, etc., which might relate to the idea of \"solid\" (固) and \"concave\" (凹).\n\nTherefore, the most reasonable answer based on the existing rules of the given graph is \\boxed{D}.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
    "valid_outputs": "```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"The character '省' (xing) in the bottom row is related to 'province', which could be considered as a general concept that encompasses various aspects like geography, administration, etc., which might relate to the idea of 'solid' (固) and 'concave' (凹).\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A\"\n  }\n]\n```",
