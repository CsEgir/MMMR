    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\n<image>The image displays an intelligence test question featuring a 3x3 grid with nine boxes, where the 9th box is marked with a question mark (?). Your task is to select the correct shape from eight options (labeled A to H) to fill the 9th box, completing the pattern that links all the shapes together.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the pattern that links all the shapes together in the 3x3 grid. Let's analyze the given shapes:\n\n1. The top row shows a diamond, a circle, and a triangle.\n2. The middle row shows a square, a triangle, and a circle.\n3. The bottom row shows a pentagon, a circle, and a star.\n\nThe question mark is located in the bottom right corner of the grid. To determine the correct shape for the question mark, we should look at the pattern that connects these shapes.\n\n- The top row has a diamond, a circle, and a triangle.\n- The middle row has a square, a triangle, and a circle.\n- The bottom row has a pentagon, a circle, and a star.\n\nWe can see that each row starts with a different shape (diamond, square, pentagon) and then repeats the same sequence of shapes (circle, triangle, star).\n\nGiven this pattern, the next shape in the sequence after the pentagon (bottom row) should be a circle. Therefore, the correct shape to fill the question mark is a circle.\n\nThus, the final answer is \\boxed{E}.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1.
