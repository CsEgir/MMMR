    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nWhat diagram replaces the question mark? Select from A, B, C, and D. (A) (B) (C) (D)\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine which diagram replaces the question mark, we need to analyze the given transformations and apply them to the initial sequence of symbols.\n\nThe initial sequence is: + IL\n\nThe transformations provided are:\n1. Switches the 2nd and 3rd symbols.\n2. Switches the 1st and 3rd symbols.\n3. Each symbol moves one place to the right.\n4. Each symbol moves one place to the left.\n\nLet's apply these transformations step by step:\n\n1. Start with + IL\n2. Apply the first transformation (switching the 2nd and 3rd symbols): I L +\n3. Apply the second transformation (switching the 1st and 3rd symbols): L I +\n4. Apply the third transformation (each symbol moves one place to the right): L I +\n5. Apply the fourth transformation (each symbol moves one place to the left): L I +\n\nNow, let's compare this result with the given options:\n\nA: \\(\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\\text { } & \\text { } \\\\ \\text { } & \\end{array}\\right.\\)\nB: \\(\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\\text { } & \\text { } \\\\ \\text { } & \\end{array}\\right.\\)\nC: \\(\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\\text { } & \\text { } \\\\ \\text { } & \\end{array}\\right.\\)\nD: \\(\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\\text { } & \\text { } \\\\ \\text { } & \\end{array}\\right.\\)\n\nAfter applying the transformations, we get L I +. This matches option D.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{D}.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
