    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nPlease select the most appropriate one from the four options and fill it in the question mark to make the graph appear regular.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine the most appropriate option to make the graph appear regular, we need to analyze the pattern in the given sequence of shapes.\n\n1. **Identify the Pattern:**\n   - The first shape is a square divided into four smaller squares.\n   - The second shape has two diagonals crossing each other inside the square.\n   - The third shape has three diagonals crossing each other inside the square.\n   - The fourth shape has four diagonals crossing each other inside the square.\n\n2. **Analyze the Options:**\n   - Option A: This shape has one diagonal crossing through the center of the square.\n   - Option B: This shape has two diagonals crossing each other inside the square.\n   - Option C: This shape has three diagonals crossing each other inside the square.\n   - Option D: This shape has four diagonals crossing each other inside the square.\n\n3. **Determine the Missing Shape:**\n   - The pattern shows that the number of diagonals increases by one with each subsequent shape.\n   - The fourth shape has four diagonals, so the next shape should have five diagonals.\n\n4. **Conclusion:**\n   - The missing shape should have five diagonals crossing each other inside the square.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{D}.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
