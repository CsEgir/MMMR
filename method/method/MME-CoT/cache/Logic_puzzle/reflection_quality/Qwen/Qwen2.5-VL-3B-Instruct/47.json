    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nThe mirror only exists when the Self is projected onto it.  Select from A, B and C. (A) True (B)False (C)Insufficient Information\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine the correct answer, let's analyze the given text and the provided statements:\n\n1. The mirror only exists when the Self is projected onto it.\n2. All mirrors reflect the Self.\n3. Objects exist as Things-in-themselves.\n4. The Self projects onto Objects.\n5. The mirror is an Object.\n6. Only Things-in-themselves exist without a projection from the self.\n\nFrom these statements, we can infer that:\n- The mirror reflects the Self (Statement 2).\n- The Self projects onto Objects (Statement 4).\n\nGiven this information, the statement \"The mirror only exists when the Self is projected onto it\" aligns with the idea that the mirror's existence is dependent on the projection of the Self onto objects.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{A}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
