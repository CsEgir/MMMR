    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nWhich of the following is folded from the square unfolding diagram in the question stem?（  ）\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine which of the given options is folded from the square unfolding diagram, we need to visualize how each option would look when unfolded. Let's analyze each option step by step:\n\n1. **Option A**: This option shows a cube with one face (the bottom face) and two adjacent faces (top left and top right). However, the top left and top right faces do not match the pattern in the original diagram. The top left face should be a horizontal line, and the top right face should be a vertical line. Therefore, this option does not match.\n\n2. **Option B**: This option shows a cube with one face (the bottom face) and two adjacent faces (top left and top right). The top left face is a horizontal line, and the top right face is a vertical line. This matches the pattern in the original diagram. Therefore, this option could be correct.\n\n3. **Option C**: This option shows a cube with one face (the bottom face) and two adjacent faces (top left and top right). The top left face is a horizontal line, but the top right face is a diagonal line. This does not match the pattern in the original diagram. Therefore, this option does not match.\n\n4. **Option D**: This option shows a cube with one face (the bottom face) and two adjacent faces (top left and top right). The top left face is a horizontal line, but the top right face is a diagonal line. This does not match the pattern in the original diagram. Therefore, this option does not match.\n\nBased on the analysis, the only option that matches the pattern in the original diagram is Option B.\n\n\\boxed{B}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
