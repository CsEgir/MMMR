    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nPlease choose the most suitable one from the four options given to make it appear regular.（）\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine the most suitable option to make the sequence regular, we need to analyze the pattern in the given shapes. The sequence provided is:\n\n1. A cup with a rounded bottom.\n2. A cone with a pointed top.\n3. A cup with a rounded bottom.\n\nThe question asks us to choose an option that fits this pattern. Let's examine each option:\n\nA. A cone with a pointed top.\nB. A cube.\nC. A pyramid.\nD. A triangular prism.\n\nOption A matches the shape of the first two shapes in the sequence (a cone with a pointed top). Option B is a cube, which does not match the shape of any of the shapes in the sequence. Option C is a pyramid, which also does not match the shape of any of the shapes in the sequence. Option D is a triangular prism, which does not match the shape of any of the shapes in the sequence either.\n\nTherefore, the most suitable option to make the sequence regular is:\n\n\\boxed{A}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
