    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nYou are given a puzzle. The puzzle consists of a question part on the top and the choices in the bottom. The question part on the top is a set of visual grids arranged in a 3 by 1 sequence, with the last piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Based on a specific pattern, one option in the choice section can be classified into the same group as the question part, while the other three options are categorized into a different group. Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this puzzle, we need to identify the pattern that governs the arrangement of shapes and symbols in the visual grids. Let's analyze the given context:\n\n1. The first grid has a square followed by a pentagon, then an arrow pointing right, and finally a square.\n2. The second grid has a triangle followed by a star, then a circle, and finally another triangle.\n\nThe missing part should follow the same pattern as the other two grids. Observing the patterns:\n- The first grid: Square → Pentagon → Arrow → Square\n- The second grid: Triangle → Star → Circle → Triangle\n\nWe can see that each grid alternates between different shapes and symbols. Therefore, the missing part should be a shape or symbol that follows the alternating sequence.\n\nNow, let's look at the choices:\n1. Square → Circle → Arrow → Square\n2. Square → Star → Star → Square\n3. Triangle → Circle → Circle → Triangle\n4. Pentagon → Hexagon → Hexagon → Pentagon\n\nAmong these choices, the one that fits the alternating pattern is Choice 1: Square → Circle → Arrow → Square.\n\nThus, the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part is \\boxed{1}.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
