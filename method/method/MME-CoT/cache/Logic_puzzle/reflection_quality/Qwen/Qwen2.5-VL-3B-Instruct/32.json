    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nYou are given a puzzle. The puzzle consists of a question part on the top and the choices in the bottom. The question part on the top is a set of visual grids arranged in a 3 by 3 matrix, with the bottom right piece missing. Choices part on the bottom contains 4 choices (marked by 1, 2, 3, or 4). Which choice (either 1, 2, 3, or 4) is the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this puzzle, we need to analyze the pattern in the visual grids and determine which choice fits best into the missing part.\n\nLet's examine the given grid:\n\n```\n 1 | 2 | 3\n---------\n 4 |   | 5\n---------\n 6 | 7 | 8\n```\n\nThe bottom right piece is missing. We need to find a pattern that matches the arrangement of the other pieces.\n\nLooking at the choices:\n- Choice 1: \n```\n 1 | 2 | 3\n---------\n 4 |   | 5\n---------\n 6 | 7 | 8\n```\nThis matches the top left piece (1) and the middle piece (2), but it doesn't match the bottom right piece (3).\n\n- Choice 2: \n```\n 1 | 2 | 3\n---------\n 4 |   | 5\n---------\n 6 | 7 | 8\n```\nThis matches the top left piece (1) and the middle piece (2), but it doesn't match the bottom right piece (3).\n\n- Choice 3: \n```\n 1 | 2 | 3\n---------\n 4 |   | 5\n---------\n 6 | 7 | 8\n```\nThis matches the top left piece (1) and the middle piece (2), but it doesn't match the bottom right piece (3).\n\n- Choice 4: \n```\n 1 | 2 | 3\n---------\n 4 |   | 5\n---------\n 6 | 7 | 8\n```\nThis matches the top left piece (1) and the middle piece (2), but it doesn't match the bottom right piece (3).\n\nNone of the choices directly match the missing piece. However, if we consider the overall pattern, it seems like the missing piece should be a vertical line with a black dot on the left side. \n\nTherefore, the most appropriate answer to fill the missing part is **Choice 1**.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1.
