    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nThis template can be folded into:\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine the correct answer, we need to visualize how the given template can be folded into one of the provided shapes. Let's analyze each option step by step:\n\n1. **Option A**: This shape has a triangular base with additional triangles on top and sides. It seems to have an irregular structure that doesn't match the symmetry or pattern of the template.\n\n2. **Option B**: This shape appears to be a cube with some faces missing. The template has a specific arrangement of dots and lines that could potentially form this shape when folded correctly.\n\n3. **Option C**: This shape looks like a dodecahedron, which is a polyhedron with twelve pentagonal faces. The template does not have enough information to form a dodecahedron.\n\n4. **Option D**: This shape resembles a truncated octahedron, which is a polyhedron with 8 regular hexagonal faces and 6 square faces. The template does not have enough information to form a truncated octahedron.\n\nGiven the template's structure, it is most likely that the correct answer is Option B, as it matches the symmetry and pattern of the template when folded correctly. Therefore, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{B}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
