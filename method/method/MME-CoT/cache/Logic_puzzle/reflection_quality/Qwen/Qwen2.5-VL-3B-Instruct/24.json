    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nPlease choose the most suitable one from the four options given and fill in the question mark to make it show a certain pattern ().\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine the most suitable option to fill in the question mark, we need to identify a pattern that connects the given shapes and their positions.\n\nLet's analyze the patterns:\n\n1. **Row 1:**\n   - Top left: 全 (a shape with a horizontal line)\n   - Top middle: 飞 (a shape with a diagonal line)\n   - Top right: < (a shape with an arrow pointing left)\n\n2. **Row 2:**\n   - Middle left: 网 (a shape with a grid pattern)\n   - Middle middle: 水 (a shape with water-like lines)\n   - Middle right: 又 (a shape with two vertical lines)\n\n3. **Row 3:**\n   - Bottom left: 房 (a shape resembling a house)\n   - Bottom middle: 坐 (a shape resembling a person sitting)\n   - Bottom right: ? (the shape we are trying to find)\n\nNow, let's look at the options provided:\n- A: 圆形 (circle)\n- B: 正方形 (square)\n- C: 三角形 (triangle)\n- D: 不规则形状 (irregular shape)\n\nWe need to find a shape that fits the pattern of the given shapes. Observing the shapes in each row, we notice that they are all geometric shapes with different orientations and patterns.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that the shapes are not immediately obvious, let's consider the symmetry and orientation of the shapes. The shapes in the rows seem to be rotated or reflected versions of each other.\n\nLooking at the options:\n- Option A is a circle.\n- Option B is a square.\n- Option C is a triangle.\n- Option D is an irregular shape.\n\nSince the shapes in the rows are rotated or reflected versions of each other, the most logical choice would be one that maintains a similar orientation or pattern. Given the complexity and the fact that the shapes are not immediately obvious, the most fitting option would be one that maintains a similar orientation or pattern.\n\nTherefore, the most suitable option to fill in the question mark is:\n\n\\boxed{D}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
