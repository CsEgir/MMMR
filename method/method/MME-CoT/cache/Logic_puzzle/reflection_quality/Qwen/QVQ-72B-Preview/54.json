Please find it.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nSo I've got this problem here. There are four figures on top and then four options below. The task is to find which one of the bottom figures can be formed by only moving the top four figures up, down, left, or right. No rotating or flipping, just sliding them around.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each of the top four figures looks like. Let's label them as Figure 1, 2, 3, and 4 from left to right.\n\nFigure 1 is a quadrilateral with one side horizontal and one vertical, kind of like an irregular shape.\n\nFigure 2 is similar but rotated a bit.\n\nFigure 3 has a different shape, maybe a triangle or a different kind of quadrilateral.\n\nFigure 4 is the smallest of them all, with a simpler shape.\n\nNow, looking at the options A, B, C, and D below.\n\nOption A shows a larger shape that seems to be composed of multiple figures.\n\nOption B looks more complex with some protrusions.\n\nOption C has a shape that might fit some combination of the top figures.\n\nOption D has a shape that also seems possible.\n\nI think I need to try to arrange the top four figures in different ways to see which one of the bottom figures they can form without rotating or flipping them.\n\nLet me try to visualize this. Maybe I can cut out the top figures and physically move them around to form one of the bottom figures.\n\nAlternatively, I can try to break down each bottom figure into parts that might correspond to the top figures.\n\nLet's start with Option A.\n\nLooking at Option A, it seems like a larger quadrilateral with some indentations or protrusions.\n\nCan I place Figure 1 somewhere and then fit the others around it?\n\nTrying to place Figure 1 in Option A, it might fit into a certain part, but I need to see if the other figures can fill in the remaining parts without overlapping.\n\nThis seems time-consuming. Maybe there's a better way.\n\nWait, perhaps I should look at the perimeter or the edge shapes to see if they match up.\n\nFor example, in Option A, the left side has a straight edge, and Figure 1 has a straight edge that could match that.\n\nBut Figure 3 also has a different shape that might not fit properly.\n\nThis is getting confusing.\n\nLet me try Option B.\n\nOption B has a more complex shape with multiple protrusions.\n\nLooking at the top figures, Figure 3 has a distinct shape that might fit into one of these protrusions.\n\nBut again, I need to see if all four figures can be placed without rotating or flipping.\n\nThis seems tricky.\n\nMoving on to Option C.\n\nOption C has a shape that seems to have some parts that could match the top figures.\n\nMaybe Figure 4, being the smallest, can fit into a corner or a smaller space.\n\nBut I need to ensure that all four figures are used exactly once.\n\nWait, the problem says \"only by panning up, down, left and right,\" which means I can move them horizontally and vertically, but not rotate or flip them.\n\nSo, perhaps I should consider the orientations.\n\nLooking back at the top figures, Figure 1 and Figure 2 are similar in shape but different in orientation.\n\nFigure 3 has a different shape, and Figure 4 is the smallest.\n\nIn Option C, there is a part that looks like Figure 3 and another part that looks like Figure 1.\n\nMaybe this is a possible match.\n\nLet me try to see if Figure 1 can be placed in one position, Figure 2 next to it, Figure 3 in another spot, and Figure 4 filling the remaining space.\n\nIf that works without any overlaps or gaps, then Option C could be the answer.\n\nAlternatively, maybe Option D also fits.\n\nOption D has a shape that seems to have parts resembling Figure 1 and Figure 4.\n\nBut I need to check if all four figures can be placed.\n\nThis is getting complicated.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the areas.\n\nIf I can calculate the area of the combined top four figures and compare it to the area of each bottom figure, they should be equal if one of them is correctly formed by panning.\n\nBut I'm not sure if that's feasible without more precise measurements.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can look at the total number of squares or something like that, but the figures aren't on a grid.\n\nThis is tricky.\n\nWait, maybe I should look at the number of sides or something like that.\n\nBut that might not help either.\n\nLet me try a different approach.\n\nSuppose I take Figure 1 and place it in Option A.\n\nThen, try to fit Figure 2 next to it, then Figure 3, and finally Figure 4.\n\nIf they all fit without overlapping and cover the entire Option A, then that's a possible answer.\n\nDoing this mentally is difficult.\n\nMaybe I should eliminate some options based on obvious mismatches.\n\nLooking at Option B, it has a very complex shape with multiple protrusions.\n\nGiven that the top figures are simpler, it's unlikely that they can form such a complex shape without rotating or flipping.\n\nSimilarly, Option D seems to have some parts that might not match the top figures' shapes.\n\nOption A looks more plausible, but I'm not sure.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps I should look at the overall shape.\n\nOption C seems to have a more straightforward shape compared to the others.\n\nMaybe that's the one.\n\nAlternatively, perhaps Option A is the correct one.\n\nWait, maybe I should consider the positions.\n\nIf I place Figure 1 in a certain position in Option A, and then place Figure 2 next to it, and so on, perhaps they fit perfectly.\n\nBut without being able to rotate or flip, it's challenging to visualize.\n\nPerhaps I should accept that this is a visual puzzle and try to trust my visual judgment.\n\nGiven that, I think Option C is the most likely answer.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is Option C.\n\n\\boxed{\\text{C}}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1.
