Select from A, B, C, and D. (A) (B) (C) (D)\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nSo I've got this problem here. There's a 3D shape labeled as the object, and it has a dark square on one of its faces. Then there are four other shapes labeled A, B, C, and D, and I need to figure out which one is a rotation of the original object. Rotation means that the shape hasn't been mirrored or changed in any other way; it's just turned around its axes.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the original object. It looks like a T-shape with a vertical stem and a horizontal bar at the top, and there's a dark square on the left side of the horizontal bar. So, the dark square is on the left face of the horizontal part of the T.\n\nNow, looking at the options:\n\nA) This one shows a similar T-shape, but the dark square is on the front face of the horizontal bar. That doesn't match the original position. So, unless there's some rotation that can make the dark square move from the left side to the front, which I don't think is possible through rotation alone, this can't be the correct answer.\n\nB) Here, the dark square is on the side of the vertical stem, towards the bottom. Again, comparing to the original, the dark square was on the left face of the horizontal bar. I don't see a way to rotate the object so that the left face of the horizontal bar becomes the side of the vertical stem. So, probably not this one.\n\nC) This option has the dark square on the right side of the horizontal bar. Wait, in the original, it was on the left side. So, if this were a mirror image, it would show the dark square on the right. But since we're dealing with rotation, not mirroring, this shouldn't be the correct answer.\n\nD) Finally, this option shows the dark square on the left side of the horizontal bar, similar to the original object. Hmm, that seems promising. But I need to make sure that the rest of the shape matches as well.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I should consider the spatial orientation more carefully. Let's try to visualize rotating the original object.\n\nSuppose the original object is oriented with the horizontal bar at the top and the vertical stem descending downwards. The dark square is on the left face of the horizontal bar.\n\nIf I rotate the object 90 degrees clockwise around the vertical axis, the horizontal bar would become diagonal, and the dark square would move to the front-left face. That doesn't match any of the options.\n\nIf I rotate it 180 degrees around the vertical axis, the horizontal bar would still be at the top, but the dark square would be on the right face now, which matches option C. But wait, option C shows the dark square on the right side, while in this rotation, it should be on the right face of the horizontal bar. Hmm, maybe I need to think differently.\n\nAlternatively, if I rotate the object 90 degrees counterclockwise around the vertical axis, the horizontal bar would shift position, and the dark square might end up on the back face. Still not matching any options.\n\nPerhaps I should try rotating around the horizontal axis. If I rotate 90 degrees around the horizontal axis, the vertical stem becomes horizontal, and the horizontal bar becomes vertical. But that changes the overall shape significantly and doesn't seem to align with any of the options.\n\nWait, maybe a combination of rotations could align the dark square to match one of the options. Let's consider rotating 90 degrees around the vertical axis and then some degrees around another axis.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should look at each option and try to see if I can rotate the original object to match it.\n\nStarting with option A: Dark square on the front face of the horizontal bar.\n\nTo achieve that from the original position, where the dark square is on the left face, I would need to rotate the object so that the left face becomes the front face. That would require a rotation of 90 degrees around the vertical axis. But in the original object, the horizontal bar is at the top, and rotating it 90 degrees would make the horizontal bar point to the right, with the dark square now on the front face. Hmm, that seems possible.\n\nWait, but in option A, the horizontal bar is still horizontal, but the dark square is on the front face. So, perhaps this is a possible rotation.\n\nNow, option B: Dark square on the side of the vertical stem.\n\nIf I rotate the original object 90 degrees around the horizontal axis, the vertical stem becomes horizontal, and the dark square moves to the side of the new horizontal stem. But in option B, the vertical stem is still vertical, so this rotation doesn't seem to fit.\n\nOption C: Dark square on the right side of the horizontal bar.\n\nThis seems like a mirror image of the original object. If I mirror the original object horizontally, the dark square would be on the right side. But we're dealing with rotation, not mirroring, so this shouldn't be possible through rotation alone.\n\nOption D: Dark square on the left side of the horizontal bar, similar to the original.\n\nThis seems like it could be the original object rotated 180 degrees around the vertical axis. If I rotate the object 180 degrees, the horizontal bar remains at the top, and the dark square is still on the left face. That seems plausible.\n\nBut wait, in option D, the overall shape looks similar to the original, but perhaps there's a difference in the way the shapes are drawn. I need to look closely.\n\nComparing the original object and option D:\n\n- Both have a T-shape with a vertical stem and a horizontal bar.\n\n- Both have a dark square on the left face of the horizontal bar.\n\nUnless there's a difference in the perspective or the way the 3D shape is represented, option D seems to be a rotation of the original object.\n\nOption A also seems possible, as the dark square is on the front face, which could be achieved through rotation.\n\nBut the question is to select which figure is a rotation of the object. So, perhaps multiple options could be considered, but let's see.\n\nWait, maybe only one of them is correct, and I need to pick the one that matches exactly.\n\nLet me consider the positions more carefully.\n\nIn the original object:\n\n- Horizontal bar is at the top.\n\n- Dark square is on the left face of the horizontal bar.\n\nOption A:\n\n- Horizontal bar is diagonal, and dark square is on the front face.\n\nThis seems like a rotation, but not sure if it exactly matches the original's dark square position.\n\nOption B:\n\n- Vertical stem is on the right side, and dark square is on the side of the stem.\n\nThis seems different from the original orientation.\n\nOption C:\n\n- Horizontal bar is at the top, but dark square is on the right face.\n\nThis is a mirror image, not a rotation.\n\nOption D:\n\n- Horizontal bar is at the top, and dark square is on the left face, same as original.\n\nThis seems like a direct rotation, possibly 180 degrees around the vertical axis.\n\nTherefore, option D is the most likely correct answer, as it maintains the position of the dark square on the left face of the horizontal bar, similar to the original object.\n\nTo confirm, if I rotate the original object 180 degrees around the vertical axis, the dark square should remain on the left face of the horizontal bar, which matches option D.\n\nTherefore, the final answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1.

            "valid_outputs": "Alright, I've got this problem here. There's a 3D shape that looks like a T with a dark square on one of its faces, and then there are four other shapes labeled A, B, C, and D. I need to figure out which one of these is a rotation of the original object. The key thing is that it's just been rotated, not mirrored or anything else.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the original object. It's a T-shape, right? So, there's a vertical stem and a horizontal bar at the top. And there's a dark square on one of the faces. Looking at the image, it seems like the dark square is on the left side of the horizontal bar.\n\nNow, I need to look at each of the options and see if they can be obtained by rotating the original object.\n\nStarting with option A: It looks like the horizontal bar is rotated to a different position, and the dark square is now on a different face. Hmm, maybe if I rotate the original object 90 degrees clockwise around the vertical axis, would that put the dark square on the front face? Let me visualize that. If the original has the dark square on the left face of the horizontal bar, rotating it 90 degrees clockwise would make the left face become the front face. So, yes, the dark square would be on the front face in this case.\n\nWait, but in option A, the dark square is on the front face. So, that seems like a possible answer.\n\nNext, option B: Here, the dark square is on the side of the vertical stem. If I rotate the original object around the horizontal axis, maybe 90 degrees, the vertical stem would become horizontal, and the dark square would move to the side. But in option B, the vertical stem is still vertical, so that doesn't seem to match. Maybe another rotation? Hmm.\n\nOption C: This one has the dark square on the right side of the horizontal bar. That seems like a mirror image of the original object. But since we're dealing with rotations, not mirrors, this probably isn't the correct answer.\n\nOption D: This looks very similar to the original object, with the dark square still on the left face of the horizontal bar. Maybe it's just a rotation around the vertical axis by 180 degrees, which would keep the dark square on the same relative face.\n\nSo, now I have to decide which one of these is indeed a rotation of the original object.\n\nLet me consider the properties of each option:\n\nOption A: Dark square on the front face after a 90-degree rotation around the vertical axis.\n\nOption D: Dark square remains on the left face after a 180-degree rotation around the vertical axis.\n\nGiven that rotation preserves the orientation of the faces, a 180-degree rotation around the vertical axis should keep the left face still on the left, just like the original. So, option D seems to match the original's dark square position.\n\nOption A, on the other hand, changes the position of the dark square to the front face, which is a different face from the original.\n\nTherefore, option D is the most likely correct answer because it maintains the position of the dark square on the left face of the horizontal bar, similar to the original object.\n\nTo confirm, if I rotate the original object 180 degrees around the vertical axis, the dark square should remain on the left face of the horizontal bar, which matches option D.\n\nSo, the final answer is D.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{D} \\]",
