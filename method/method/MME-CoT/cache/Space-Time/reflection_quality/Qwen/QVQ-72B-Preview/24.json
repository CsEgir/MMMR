            "valid_outputs": "Alright, I've got this problem here. It shows four different views of some cubes, and I need to figure out how many unique objects there are in total based on these views. Let's see...\n\nFirst, I need to understand what each view is showing. There are cubes of different colors and some other shapes like a pyramid and a sphere in certain views. The task is to count the total number of unique objects across all views, making sure not to count any object more than once.\n\nLet me list out what each view shows:\n\n1. **First View**: 5 cubes.\n\n2. **Second View**: 6 cubes, including a purple pyramid.\n\n3. **Third View**: 7 cubes, including a purple sphere.\n\n4. **Fourth View**: 8 cubes, including a purple cube.\n\nSo, if I just add them all up: 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 = 26. But wait, that can't be right because some objects might be visible in multiple views. For example, if a cube is seen in both the first and second views, I should only count it once.\n\nI need a better way to account for overlapping objects across views. Maybe I should try to identify which objects are unique to each view and which are shared.\n\nLet's consider the objects mentioned in each view:\n\n- **First View**: 5 cubes.\n\n- **Second View**: 6 cubes (including the purple pyramid). So, besides the purple pyramid, there are 5 cubes. But wait, the first view already has 5 cubes. Maybe some of these cubes are the same as in the first view.\n\n- **Third View**: 7 cubes (including the purple sphere). Again, besides the purple sphere, there are 6 cubes. Some of these might overlap with the first or second views.\n\n- **Fourth View**: 8 cubes (including the purple cube). So, besides the purple cube, there are 7 cubes. These might also overlap with previous views.\n\nI need to find out how many unique objects there are in total, considering possible overlaps.\n\nPerhaps I should start by assuming that all cubes are unique unless specified otherwise. But that doesn't seem right because clearly, some cubes must be the same across views.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I can think of it as a Venn diagram with four sets, each representing the objects seen in one view, and try to find the total unique objects by subtracting the overlaps.\n\nBut without knowing exactly which cubes are shared between views, this is tricky.\n\nWait a minute, maybe I can look at the objects that are unique to each view.\n\nLooking at the second view, it mentions a purple pyramid, which is likely unique to that view. Similarly, the third view has a purple sphere, and the fourth view has a purple cube. The first view only has cubes, but no specific color mentioned.\n\nAssuming that the purple objects are distinct and not present in other views, I can consider them as unique additions to the total count.\n\nSo, starting with the first view: 5 cubes.\n\nThen, the second view has 6 cubes plus one purple pyramid. But some of these cubes might already be counted in the first view. However, the purple pyramid is unique.\n\nSimilarly, the third view has 7 cubes plus one purple sphere, and the fourth view has 8 cubes plus one purple cube.\n\nIf I assume that each view adds unique objects on top of what's already been counted, then perhaps I can add the unique objects from each view.\n\nBut I need to be careful not to double-count the cubes that are visible in multiple views.\n\nMaybe I should try to identify the overlapping objects.\n\nLet's consider that the first view has 5 cubes. The second view has 6 cubes, so perhaps 5 of them are the same as in the first view, and one is new, plus the purple pyramid.\n\nSimilarly, the third view has 7 cubes, so maybe 6 of them are the same as in the second view, and one is new, plus the purple sphere.\n\nAnd the fourth view has 8 cubes, so maybe 7 of them are the same as in the third view, and one is new, plus the purple cube.\n\nFollowing this pattern, the total number of unique cubes would be:\n\n- First view: 5 cubes\n\n- Second view: 1 new cube + purple pyramid\n\n- Third view: 1 new cube + purple sphere\n\n- Fourth view: 1 new cube + purple cube\n\nSo, total cubes = 5 (from first view) + 1 (second view) + 1 (third view) + 1 (fourth view) = 8 cubes\n\nPlus the unique shapes: purple pyramid, purple sphere, and purple cube.\n\nSo, total unique objects = 8 cubes + 1 pyramid + 1 sphere + 1 cube = 11 objects.\n\nWait, but that doesn't seem right either. If the second view has 6 cubes, and the first view has 5, then the second view has 1 new cube plus the 5 from the first view, plus the purple pyramid.\n\nSimilarly, the third view has 7 cubes, so perhaps it has the 6 from the second view plus 1 new cube, plus the purple sphere.\n\nAnd the fourth view has 8 cubes, so it has the 7 from the third view plus 1 new cube, plus the purple cube.\n\nSo, total unique cubes = 5 (first view) + 1 (second view) + 1 (third view) + 1 (fourth view) = 8 cubes\n\nPlus the unique shapes: purple pyramid, purple sphere, purple cube.\n\nTotal unique objects = 8 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 11\n\nBut let's verify this.\n\nFirst view: 5 cubes (all new)\n\nSecond view: 6 cubes (5 from first view + 1 new) + purple pyramid\n\nThird view: 7 cubes (6 from second view + 1 new) + purple sphere\n\nFourth view: 8 cubes (7 from third view + 1 new) + purple cube\n\nSo, unique cubes: 5 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 8\n\nUnique shapes: pyramid, sphere, cube \u2192 3\n\nTotal: 8 + 3 = 11\n\nBut the initial solution added all the cubes from each view without considering overlaps, resulting in 26, which is clearly incorrect.\n\nSo, 11 seems more reasonable.\n\nBut let's check another approach.\n\nPerhaps I should consider the maximum number of unique objects possible.\n\nIf no cubes overlap across views, then total objects would be:\n\nFirst view: 5 cubes\n\nSecond view: 6 cubes + 1 pyramid = 7\n\nThird view: 7 cubes + 1 sphere = 8\n\nFourth view: 8 cubes + 1 cube = 9\n\nTotal: 5 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 29 objects\n\nBut that's higher than 26, which was the initial incorrect total.\n\nWait, but that can't be right because some cubes must be shared across views.\n\nAlternatively, maybe I should consider that each subsequent view includes all the cubes from the previous views plus some new ones.\n\nIf that's the case, then:\n\nFirst view: 5 cubes\n\nSecond view: includes all 5 from first view + 1 new cube + pyramid \u2192 total 7 objects\n\nThird view: includes all 6 from second view + 1 new cube + sphere \u2192 total 8 objects\n\nFourth view: includes all 7 from third view + 1 new cube + cube \u2192 total 9 objects\n\nBut in this case, the total unique objects would be:\n\n- Cubes: 5 (first view) + 1 (second view) + 1 (third view) + 1 (fourth view) = 8 cubes\n\n- Shapes: pyramid, sphere, cube = 3\n\nTotal: 8 + 3 = 11\n\nThis matches my previous calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that each view has additional unique cubes beyond the previous view, then:\n\nFirst view: 5 cubes\n\nSecond view: 5 from first view + 1 new cube + pyramid \u2192 total unique cubes: 6\n\nThird view: 6 from second view + 1 new cube + sphere \u2192 total unique cubes: 7\n\nFourth view: 7 from third view + 1 new cube + cube \u2192 total unique cubes: 8\n\nAgain, total unique cubes: 8\n\nUnique shapes: pyramid, sphere, cube = 3\n\nTotal: 8 + 3 = 11\n\nThis seems consistent.\n\nWait, but in the initial solution, it added all the cubes from each view without considering overlaps, which is incorrect.\n\nSo, perhaps 11 is the correct answer.\n\nBut let's think differently.\n\nSuppose I try to list all the objects:\n\n1. First view: cubes A, B, C, D, E (5 cubes)\n\n2. Second view: cubes A, B, C, D, E, F + pyramid P\n\n3. Third view: cubes A, B, C, D, E, F, G + sphere S\n\n4. Fourth view: cubes A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H + cube C\n\nWait, in the fourth view, it's 8 cubes, including a purple cube. But the other cubes are presumably the same as in the third view plus one new cube.\n\nSo, total unique cubes: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H = 8\n\nUnique shapes: P (pyramid), S (sphere), C (purple cube) = 3\n\nTotal: 8 + 3 = 11\n\nThis seems to confirm the earlier calculation.\n\nAlternatively, if I consider that the purple cube in the fourth view is one of the existing cubes, say cube C, then perhaps it's a different object.\n\nBut the description says \"including a purple cube,\" which might be a new object, distinct from the other cubes.\n\nSo, probably, it's a separate object.\n\nTherefore, total unique objects: 8 cubes + 3 unique shapes = 11\n\nI think this is the correct answer.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there are any other objects or any overlapping that I might have missed.\n\nLooking back at the views:\n\n- First view: 5 cubes\n\n- Second view: 6 cubes (including the 5 from first view + 1 new) + pyramid\n\n- Third view: 7 cubes (including the 6 from second view + 1 new) + sphere\n\n- Fourth view: 8 cubes (including the 7 from third view + 1 new) + purple cube\n\nEach new cube added in subsequent views is distinct, and the unique shapes are additional distinct objects.\n\nHence, total unique objects: 8 cubes + 3 shapes = 11\n\nI can't see any other way to interpret this, so I'm confident that 11 is the correct answer.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{11} \\]",
