    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nThe first image is the original image, and the following images are the pieces of the original image. Put the pieces back together in the correct order. Your options are: A. [3, 1, 2, 0], B. [2, 0, 1, 3], C. [2, 1, 0, 3], D. [0, 2, 1, 3].\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine the correct order of the images, we need to analyze the sequence of elements in each image and match them logically. Let's break down the process:\n\n1. **Identify Key Elements**: Look for consistent elements across all images that can help establish a logical sequence.\n2. **Analyze Each Image**: Carefully examine each image to identify key features or patterns.\n3. **Match Images**: Arrange the images based on the identified key elements.\n\nLet's start with the first image:\n- The first image shows a forested area with trees, rocks, and a stream flowing through it.\n\nNow, let's look at the second image:\n- This image also shows a forested area but with a different perspective. It includes more trees and possibly some distant hills or mountains.\n\nNext, consider the third image:\n- This image appears to be a close-up of a tree trunk or log, which is not present in the first two images.\n\nFinally, look at the fourth image:\n- This image seems to show a broader view of the forested area, similar to the first image but with a slightly different angle or composition.\n\nBased on this analysis, the logical sequence should be:\n1. Close-up of a tree trunk/log (third image)\n2. Broader view of the forested area (fourth image)\n3. Forested area with trees and rocks (second image)\n4. Forested area with trees and rocks (first image)\n\nTherefore, the correct order is: [3, 4, 2, 1].\n\nSo, the final answer is \\boxed{[3, 4, 2, 1]}.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
    "valid_outputs": "```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"The reflection step identified is 'Wait xxx', which suggests a pause to reconsider the previous conclusion.\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A\"\n  }\n]\n```",
