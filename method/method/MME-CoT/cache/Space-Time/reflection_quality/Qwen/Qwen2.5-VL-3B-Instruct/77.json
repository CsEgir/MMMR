    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\n<image> <image> <image> The man opens the door. What is the correct order of images according to the given context?\nA. the third image, the first image, the second image\nB. the third image, the second image, the first image\nC. the second image, the first image, the third image\nD. None of the choices provided\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine the correct order of images according to the given context, let's analyze the sequence step by step:\n\n1. The man opens the door.\n2. He looks inside the room.\n3. He sees another person standing in the doorway.\n\nBased on this sequence:\n- The first image shows the man opening the door.\n- The second image shows him looking inside the room.\n- The third image shows him seeing another person standing in the doorway.\n\nTherefore, the correct order of images is: the first image, the second image, the third image.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{C}.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
