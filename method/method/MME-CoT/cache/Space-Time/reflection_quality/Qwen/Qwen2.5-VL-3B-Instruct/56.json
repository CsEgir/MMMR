    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nThe first image is the original image, and the following images are the pieces of the original image. Put the pieces back together in the correct order. Your options are: A. [3, 1, 2, 0], B. [0, 3, 2, 1], C. [1, 3, 2, 0], D. [1, 2, 3, 0].\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this problem, we need to identify the correct order of the pieces that make up the original image. The original image is a panoramic view of a city skyline with clouds in the sky.\n\nLet's analyze each option:\n\nA. [3, 1, 2, 0]\n- This suggests that piece 3 is at the top, piece 1 is below it, piece 2 is below piece 1, and piece 0 is at the bottom.\n- This arrangement does not match the typical layout of a city skyline with clouds in the sky.\n\nB. [0, 3, 2, 1]\n- This suggests that piece 0 is at the bottom, piece 3 is above it, piece 2 is above piece 3, and piece 1 is above piece 2.\n- This arrangement also does not match the typical layout of a city skyline with clouds in the sky.\n\nC. [1, 3, 2, 0]\n- This suggests that piece 1 is at the bottom, piece 3 is above it, piece 2 is above piece 3, and piece 0 is at the top.\n- This arrangement matches the typical layout of a city skyline with clouds in the sky.\n\nD. [1, 2, 3, 0]\n- This suggests that piece 1 is at the bottom, piece 2 is above it, piece 3 is above piece 2, and piece 0 is at the top.\n- This arrangement also does not match the typical layout of a city skyline with clouds in the sky.\n\nBased on the analysis, the correct order of the pieces is C. [1, 3, 2, 0].\n\n\\boxed{C}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
