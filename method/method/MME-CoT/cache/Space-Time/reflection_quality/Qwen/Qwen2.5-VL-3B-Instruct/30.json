    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nHow many objects are there in the scene based on these views?\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo determine the number of objects in the scene based on these views, let's analyze each view:\n\n1. **Top-left view**: There are three cylinders and two cubes.\n2. **Top-right view**: There are four objects: one cylinder, one cube, one small brown object (which appears to be a cylinder), and one larger green cube.\n3. **Bottom-left view**: There are three objects: one large green cube, one cylinder, and one small green sphere.\n4. **Bottom-right view**: This view is empty.\n\nBy combining all the information from the four views, we can see that there are at least five distinct objects:\n- Three cylinders\n- Two cubes\n- One small brown object (cylinder)\n- One large green cube\n- One small green sphere\n\nTherefore, the final answer is \\boxed{5}.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
