    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nThe first image is the original image, and the following images are the pieces of the original image. Put the pieces back together in the correct order. Your options are: A. [2, 3, 0, 1], B. [0, 1, 2, 3], C. [1, 2, 3, 0], D. [0, 2, 3, 1].\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order in which the pieces of the original image should be assembled. The key is to identify the parts that are most likely to belong together based on their visual characteristics.\n\n1. **Identify the main components:**\n   - The center of the flower (the yellow and green part).\n   - The petals (the white parts).\n\n2. **Analyze the given options:**\n   - Option A: [2, 3, 0, 1]\n   - Option B: [0, 1, 2, 3]\n   - Option C: [1, 2, 3, 0]\n   - Option D: [0, 2, 3, 1]\n\n3. **Match the components:**\n   - The center of the flower (yellow and green) is typically located at the bottom or center of the image.\n   - The petals are usually distributed around the center.\n\n4. **Determine the correct sequence:**\n   - In option B: [0, 1, 2, 3], the first piece (0) seems to be a petal, followed by the second piece (1), then the third piece (2), and finally the fourth piece (3). This matches our observation that petals are distributed around the center and the center is typically at the bottom or center.\n\nTherefore, the correct order to assemble the image is:\n\n\\boxed{B}\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
