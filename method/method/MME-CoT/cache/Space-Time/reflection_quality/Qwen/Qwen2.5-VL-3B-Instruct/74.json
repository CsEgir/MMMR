    "question": "Here's a refined prompt that improves clarity and structure:\n\n# Task\nEvaluate reflection steps in image-based problem solutions, where reflections are self-corrections or reconsiderations of previous statements.\n\n# Reflection Step Identification \nReflections typically begin with phrases like:\n- \"But xxx\"\n- \"Alternatively, xxx\" \n- \"Maybe I should\"\n- \"Let me double-check\"\n- \"Wait xxx\"\n- \"Perhaps xxx\"\nIt will throw an doubt of its previously reached conclusion or raise a new thought.\n\n# Evaluation Criteria\nCorrect reflections must:\n1. Reach accurate conclusions aligned with ground truth\n2. Use new insights to find the mistake of the previous conclusion or verify its correctness. \n\nInvalid reflections include:\n1. Repetition - Restating previous content or method without new insights\n2. Wrong Conclusion - Reaching incorrect conclusions vs ground truth\n3. Incompleteness - Proposing but not executing new analysis methods\n4. Other - Additional error types\n\n# Input Format\n```\n[Problem]\nCan you identify the sequence of actions in this video and list them in order? <image> <image> <image> <image> <image> <image> <image> <image> .\nA. None of the choices provided\nB. grab teabag, approach kettle, lift kettle, pour boiling water into cup, stir tea in cup\nC. hold teabag, move to kettle, lift kettle lid, pour water into cup, stir tea in cup\nD. carry teabag, reach kettle, carry kettle, pour water, carry kettle\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\nThe sequence of actions in the video is as follows:\n\n1. Approach the kettle.\n2. Lift the kettle lid.\n3. Pour boiling water into a cup.\n4. Stir the tea in the cup.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{C}.\n\n```\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format must be in valid JSON format without any other content.\n2. Output maximum 30 reflection steps.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n```json\n[\n  {\n    \"conclusion\": \"One-sentence summary of reflection outcome\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Correct|Wrong\",\n    \"error_type\": \"N/A|Repetition|Wrong Conclusion|Incompleteness|Other\"\n  }\n]\n```\n\n# Rules\n1. Preserve original content and order\n2. No new interpretations\n3. Include ALL reflection steps\n4. Empty list if no reflections found\n5. Direct JSON output without any other output",
