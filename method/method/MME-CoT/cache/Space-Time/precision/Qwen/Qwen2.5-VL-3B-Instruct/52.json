    "question": "# Task Overview\nGiven a solution with multiple reasoning steps for an image-based problem, reformat it into well-structured steps and evaluate their correctness.\n\n# Step 1: Reformatting the Solution\nConvert the unstructured solution into distinct reasoning steps while:\n- Preserving all original content and order\n- Not adding new interpretations\n- Not omitting any steps\n\n## Step Types\n1. Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Correctness\nEvaluate each step against:\n\n## Ground Truth Matching\nFor image descriptions:\n- Key elements must match ground truth descriptions\n\nFor logical inferences:\n- Conclusion must EXACTLY match or be DIRECTLY entailed by ground truth\n\n## Reasonableness Check (if no direct match)\nStep must:\n- Premises must not contradict any ground truth or correct answer\n- Logic is valid\n- Conclusion must not contradict any ground truth \n- Conclusion must support or be neutral to correct answer\n\n\n## Judgement Categories\n- \"Match\": Aligns with ground truth\n- \"Reasonable\": Valid but not in ground truth\n- \"Wrong\": Invalid or contradictory\n- \"N/A\": For background information steps\n\n# Output Requirements\n1. The output format MUST be in valid JSON format without ANY other content.\n2. For highly repetitive patterns, output it as a single step.\n3. Output maximum 35 steps. Always include the final step that contains the answer.\n\nHere is the json output format:\n## Output Format\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"premise\": \"Evidence (only for logical inference)\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Step result\",\n    \"judgment\": \"Match|Reasonable|Wrong|N/A\"\n  }\n]\n\nHere is the problem, and the solution that needs to be reformatted to steps:\n\n[Problem]\n\nThe first image is the original image, and the following images are the pieces of the original image. Put the pieces back together in the correct order. Your options are: A. [2, 0, 1, 3], B. [1, 2, 0, 3], C. [0, 3, 1, 2], D. [2, 0, 3, 1].\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.\n\n[Solution]\n\nTo solve this problem, we need to determine the correct order of the images based on their content. Let's analyze each image:\n\n1. The first image shows a coastal scene with a clear blue sky, mountains in the distance, and a beach.\n2. The second image is a close-up of the sky, showing a gradient from light to dark blue.\n3. The third image shows a beach with waves and a distant mountain range.\n4. The fourth image is another close-up of the sky, similar to the second image.\n\nNow, let's match these descriptions to the options provided:\n\n- Option A: [2, 0, 1, 3]\n  - This suggests that the sequence starts with the second image (close-up of the sky), followed by the first image (coastal scene), then the third image (beach), and finally the fourth image (another close-up of the sky).\n  \n- Option B: [1, 2, 0, 3]\n  - This suggests that the sequence starts with the first image (coastal scene), followed by the second image (close-up of the sky), then the fourth image (another close-up of the sky), and finally the third image (beach).\n\n- Option C: [0, 3, 1, 2]\n  - This suggests that the sequence starts with the fourth image (another close-up of the sky), followed by the third image (beach), then the first image (coastal scene), and finally the second image (close-up of the sky).\n\n- Option D: [2, 0, 3, 1]\n  - This suggests that the sequence starts with the second image (close-up of the sky), followed by the fourth image (another close-up of the sky), then the third image (beach), and finally the first image (coastal scene).\n\nGiven the descriptions, the most logical order would be:\n1. Close-up of the sky\n2. Coastal scene\n3. Beach\n4. Another close-up of the sky\n\nTherefore, the correct order is option A: [2, 0, 1, 3].\n\n\\boxed{A}\n\n[Correct Answer]\n\nB",
