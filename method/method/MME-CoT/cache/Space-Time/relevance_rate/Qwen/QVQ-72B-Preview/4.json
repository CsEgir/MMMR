Logical Inference Steps\n   - Contains exactly one logical deduction\n   - Must produce a new derived conclusion\n   - Cannot be just a summary or observation\n\n2. Image Description Steps\n   - Pure visual observations\n   - Only includes directly visible elements\n   - No inferences or assumptions\n\n3. Background Information Steps\n   - External knowledge or question context\n   - No inference process involved\n\n## Step Requirements\n- Each step must be atomic (one conclusion per step)\n- No content duplication across steps\n- Initial analysis counts as background information\n- Final answer determination counts as logical inference\n\n# Step 2: Evaluating Relevancy\nA relevant step is considered as: 75% content of the step must be related to trying to get a solution (ignore correct or wrong) to the question. \n\n**IMPORTANT NOTE**: \nEvaluate relevancy independent of correctness. As long as the step is trying to get to a solution, it is considered relevant. Logical fallacy, knowledge mistake, inconsistent with previous steps, or other mistakes do not affect relevance.\nA logically wrong step can be relevant if the reasoning attempts to address the question.\n\nThe following behaviour is considered as relevant:\ni. The step is planning, summarizing, thinking, verifying, calculating, or confirming an intermediate/final conclusion helpful to get a solution.\nii. The step is summarizing or reflecting on previously reached conclusion relevant to get a solution.\niii. Repeating the information in the question or give the final answer.\niv. A relevant image depiction shoule be in one of following situation: 1. help to obtain a conclusion helpful to solve the question later; 2. help to identify certain patterns in the image later; 3. directly contributes to the answer\nv. Depicting or analyzing the options of the question is also relevant.\nvi. Repeating previous relevant steps are also considered relevant. \n\nThe following behaviour is considered as irrelevant: \ni. Depicting image information that does not related to what is asking in the question.  Example: The question asks how many cars are present in all the images. If the step focuses on other visual elements like the road or building, the step is considered as irrelevant.\nii. Self-thought not related to what the question is asking.\niii.

            "valid_outputs": "Alright, I've got this task to evaluate a solution for an image-based problem. The problem is about describing a sequence of images showing a water skier performing tricks on a lake. The solution provided is a paragraph that summarizes what's happening in the sequence. My job is to break this solution down into distinct reasoning steps and evaluate whether each step is relevant to getting a solution, regardless of whether it's correct or not.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what constitutes a relevant step. According to the guidelines, a relevant step must have at least 75% of its content related to trying to get a solution to the question. This can include logical inferences, image descriptions, background information, planning, summarizing, thinking, verifying, calculating, confirming intermediate or final conclusions, repeating previous relevant steps, or depicting or analyzing the options provided.\n\nIrrelevant steps are those that depict image information not related to the question, self-thought not related to the question, or other tangential information.\n\nGiven that, I need to reformat the provided solution into distinct steps. The solution is currently a single paragraph describing the sequence:\n\n\"The image sequence depicts a water skier performing various tricks on a lake. In the first frame, the skier is seen gliding smoothly across the water's surface. As the sequence progresses, the skier executes a series of aerial maneuvers, including jumps and flips, showcasing their skill and control over the water ski. The skier maintains balance and precision throughout the performance, with each frame capturing a different phase of the trick. The background features a serene lake surrounded by lush greenery and hills, providing a picturesque setting for the dynamic water skiing action.\"\n\nI need to break this down into steps. Let's see:\n\n1. Identify the main subject of the images: a water skier performing tricks on a lake.\n\n2. Describe the initial position or action in the first frame: the skier is gliding smoothly across the water's surface.\n\n3. Explain how the sequence progresses: the skier performs aerial maneuvers like jumps and flips.\n\n4. Comment on the skier's skill and control throughout the performance.\n\n5. Mention that each frame captures a different phase of the trick.\n\n6. Describe the background: a serene lake surrounded by lush greenery and hills.\n\nNow, I need to categorize these steps into image description, logical inference, or background information.\n\n- Step 1: Identifying the main subject seems like a logical inference because it's interpreting what the images are about.\n\n- Step 2: Describing the first frame is an image description.\n\n- Step 3: Explaining how the sequence progresses is also a logical inference.\n\n- Step 4: Commenting on the skier's skill and control is another logical inference based on the observed actions.\n\n- Step 5: Mentioning that each frame captures a different phase of the trick is again a logical inference.\n\n- Step 6: Describing the background is an image description.\n\nSo, in terms of relevance, all these steps are directly related to describing the image sequence and interpreting what's happening, which is the core of the problem. There doesn't seem to be any irrelevant information here.\n\nWait, but the problem says to evaluate whether each step is relevant, meaning at least 75% of its content should be related to trying to get a solution. In this case, all the steps are about describing the images or making inferences about the actions depicted, which is exactly what the problem is asking for.\n\nI don't see any steps that are depicting unrelated image information or self-thought not related to the question. So, all the steps should be relevant.\n\nBut maybe I need to look closer. Let's consider if any step is more of a planning or summarizing step.\n\nLooking back at the solution, it starts by identifying the subject, then describes the initial action, followed by how the sequence progresses, and includes comments on the skier's skill and the background.\n\nEach of these steps seems pertinent to the task of describing the image sequence. The comments on skill and the background provide context and detail to the description, which is beneficial for understanding the sequence.\n\nTherefore, in this case, all the steps are relevant to getting a solution to the problem.\n\nWait, but the problem mentions that repeating previous relevant steps are also considered relevant. In this description, there might be some repetition if multiple frames show similar actions or if the description loops back to previous points, but in this particular solution, it seems to be a linear description without much repetition.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- Step 1: Logical inference (identifying main subject)\n\n- Step 2: Image description (first frame)\n\n- Step 3: Logical inference (progression of sequence)\n\n- Step 4: Logical inference (skier's skill and control)\n\n- Step 5: Logical inference (different phases of the trick)\n\n- Step 6: Image description (background)\n\nAll these steps are directly related to describing and interpreting the image sequence, which is the goal of the problem.\n\nHence, all steps are relevant.\n\nBut to be thorough, let's consider if there could be any irrelevant steps in a different scenario.\n\nSuppose, for example, that one of the steps was describing something not present in the images, like mentioning imaginary elements or focusing on unrelated background details that don't contribute to understanding the sequence. That would be irrelevant.\n\nHowever, in this particular solution, all described elements are relevant to the sequence of a water skier performing tricks on a lake.\n\nTherefore, my final assessment is that all steps are relevant.\n\nNow, I need to format this into the required output format:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description|logical inference|background information\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"A brief summary of step result\",\n    \"relevant\": \"Yes|No\"\n  }\n]\n\nGiven that, I would list each step with its type, conclusion, and relevance.\n\nBut since the solution provided is a single paragraph, I need to dissect it into steps.\n\nLet me try to reformat it:\n\nStep 1: Identify the main subject\n\n- Type: Logical Inference\n\n- Conclusion: The main subject is a water skier performing tricks on a lake.\n\n- Relevant: Yes\n\nStep 2: Describe the first frame\n\n- Type: Image Description\n\n- Conclusion: The skier is gliding smoothly across the water's surface.\n\n- Relevant: Yes\n\nStep 3: Describe the progression of the sequence\n\n- Type: Logical Inference\n\n- Conclusion: The skier performs aerial maneuvers like jumps and flips.\n\n- Relevant: Yes\n\nStep 4: Assess the skier's skill and control\n\n- Type: Logical Inference\n\n- Conclusion: The skier maintains balance and precision throughout.\n\n- Relevant: Yes\n\nStep 5: Explain the different phases captured in each frame\n\n- Type: Logical Inference\n\n- Conclusion: Each frame captures a different phase of the trick.\n\n- Relevant: Yes\n\nStep 6: Describe the background\n\n- Type: Image Description\n\n- Conclusion: The background features a serene lake surrounded by lush greenery and hills.\n\n- Relevant: Yes\n\nSo, in JSON format, it would look like:\n\n[\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"logical inference\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"The main subject is a water skier performing tricks on a lake.\",\n    \"relevant\": \"Yes\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"The skier is gliding smoothly across the water's surface.\",\n    \"relevant\": \"Yes\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"logical inference\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"The skier performs aerial maneuvers like jumps and flips.\",\n    \"relevant\": \"Yes\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"logical inference\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"The skier maintains balance and precision throughout.\",\n    \"relevant\": \"Yes\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"logical inference\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"Each frame captures a different phase of the trick.\",\n    \"relevant\": \"Yes\"\n  },\n  {\n    \"step_type\": \"image description\",\n    \"conclusion\": \"The background features a serene lake surrounded by lush greenery and hills.\",\n    \"relevant\": \"Yes\"\n  }\n]\n\nThis should be the output.\n\nBut the problem also says to output at most 40 steps. In this case, we have 6 steps, which is well within that limit.\n\nI think this covers the task overview and the evaluation of the solution steps.\n\n**Final Answer**\n\n\\[ \\boxed{\\text{All steps are relevant.}} \\]",
