The forward and left-back views show a vehicle approximately 30 meters ahead traveling at a similar speed. The right-back view reveals sparse roadside vegetation and no immediate obstacles or other vehicles. The autonomous vehicle's current cruise speed is 72 km/h, and its overtaking maneuver requires a minimum clear forward stretch of 100 meters and a 6-second window with no oncoming traffic. If the road ahead curves slightly to the left and visibility is partially obscured by trees, which of the following strategies should the vehicle employ to ensure safety and compliance with standard autonomous navigation protocols?\n\nA. Immediately begin the overtaking maneuver before entering the curve to reduce time behind the slower vehicle\nB. Maintain current speed and closely follow the lead vehicle until it exits the curve, then reassess visibility\nC.
