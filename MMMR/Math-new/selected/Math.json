That means that $P$ and $Q$ are the centroids of triangles $ABD$ and $CBD,$ respectively. Since $AC = 15,$ that means $CQ = 5,$ since the median from $C$ to $BD$ is half the length of $AC,$ or $7.5,$ and $CQ$ must be $\\frac{2}{3}$ of that, or $5.$ Therefore, $QA = AC - CQ = 15 - 5 = \\boxed{10}.$\n\nSolution 2: Since $ABCD$ is a parallelogram, $\\overline{AD}$ and $\\overline{BC}$ are parallel with $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{DN}$ as transversals.  So $\\angle DAQ = \\angle NCQ$ and $\\angle ADQ = \\angle CNQ$, and so $\\triangle ADQ$ and $\\triangle CNQ$ are similar by AA similarity.\n\nAlso, we know opposite sides of a parallelogram are congruent, so $AD = BC$.

By similar triangles, \\[ \\frac{AQ}{CQ} = \\frac{AD}{CN} = 2, \\]so $AQ = 2CQ.$  Since $AQ + CQ = AC = 15$, we have $CQ = 5$ and $AQ = \\boxed{10}.$",

The area of triangle $ADF$ is $y(u + v)/2 = 5$, so $y(u + v) = 10$.  The area of triangle $CEF$ is $xv/2 = 9$, so $xv = 18$.  Thus, we have the system of equations \\begin{align*}\nux + uy &= 16, \\\\\nuy + vy &= 10, \\\\\nvx &= 18.\n\\end{align*} Solving for $x$ in equation (1), we find \\[x = \\frac{16 - uy}{u}.\\] Solving for $v$ in equation (2), we find \\[v = \\frac{10 - uy}{y}.\\] Substituting into equation (3), we get \\[\\frac{10 - uy}{y} \\cdot \\frac{16 - uy}{u} = 18.\\] This equation simplifies to \\[u^2 y^2 - 44uy + 160 = 0.\\] We recognize this equation as a quadratic in $uy$, which factors as $(uy - 4)(uy - 40) = 0$.
