    "question": "In this problem you have to implement an algorithm to defragment your hard disk. The hard disk consists of a sequence of clusters, numbered by integers from 1 to n. The disk has m recorded files, the i-th file occupies clusters with numbers a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, ..., a_{i, ni}. These clusters are not necessarily located consecutively on the disk, but the order in which they are given corresponds to their sequence in the file (cluster a_{i, 1} contains the first fragment of the i-th file, cluster a_{i, 2} has the second fragment, etc.). Also the disc must have one or several clusters which are free from files.\nYou are permitted to perform operations of copying the contents of cluster number i to cluster number j (i and j must be different). Moreover, if the cluster number j used to keep some information, it is lost forever. Clusters are not cleaned, but after the defragmentation is complete, some of them are simply declared unusable (although they may possibly still contain some fragments of files).\nYour task is to use a sequence of copy operations to ensure that each file occupies a contiguous area of memory. Each file should occupy a consecutive cluster section, the files must follow one after another from the beginning of the hard disk. After defragmentation all free (unused) clusters should be at the end of the hard disk. After defragmenting files can be placed in an arbitrary order. Clusters of each file should go consecutively from first to last. See explanatory examples in the notes.\nPrint the sequence of operations leading to the disk defragmentation. Note that you do not have to minimize the number of operations, but it should not exceed 2n.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 200) — the number of clusters and the number of files, correspondingly. Next m lines contain descriptions of the files. The first number in the line is n_{i} (n_{i} ≥ 1), the number of clusters occupied by the i-th file. Then follow n_{i} numbers a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2}, ..., a_{i, ni} (1 ≤ a_{i, j} ≤ n). It is guaranteed that each cluster number occurs not more than once and ![image](1.png), that is, there exists at least one unused cluster. Numbers on each line are separated by spaces. \n\nOutput\nIn the first line print a single integer k (0 ≤ k ≤ 2n) — the number of operations needed to defragment the disk. Next k lines should contain the operations' descriptions as \"i j\" (copy the contents of the cluster number i to the cluster number j). \n\nExamples\nInput\n7 2\n2 1 2\n3 3 4 5\n\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\nInput\n7 2\n2 1 3\n3 2 4 5\n\n\nOutput\n3\n2 6\n3 2\n6 3\n\n\n\n\nNote\nLet's say that a disk consists of 8 clusters and contains two files. The first file occupies two clusters and the second file occupies three clusters. Let's look at examples of correct and incorrect positions of files after defragmentation. \n![image](2.png)Example 2: each file must occupy a contiguous area of memory.\nExample 3: the order of files to each other is not important, at first the second file can be written, and then — the first one.\nExample 4: violating the order of file fragments to each other is not allowed.\nExample 5: unused clusters should be located at the end, and in this example the unused clusters are 3, 7, 8.\n\n\n\nPlease use a python program to solve this problem\n\nexample_input:\n7 3\n1 7\n2 6 5\n3 4 3 2\n\n\nexample_output:\n7\n7 1\n2 7\n6 2\n3 6\n5 3\n6 5\n7 6\n\n\nTime limit:\n1 second\n\nMemory limit:\n256 megabytes\n",

    "question": "\n\nProblem L\nWall Making Game\n\nThe game Wall Making Game, a two-player board game, is all the rage.\n\nThis game is played on an $H \\times W$ board. Each cell of the board is one of empty, marked, or wall. At the beginning of the game, there is no wall on the board.\n\nIn this game, two players alternately move as follows:\n\n-  A player chooses one of the empty cells (not marked and not wall). If the player can't choose a cell, he loses.\n-  Towards each of the four directions (upper, lower, left, and right) from the chosen cell, the player changes cells (including the chosen cell) to walls until the player first reaches a wall or the outside of the board.\n\nNote that marked cells cannot be chosen in step 1, but they can be changed to walls in step 2.\n\nFig.1 shows an example of a move in which a player chooses the cell at the third row and the fourth\ncolumn.\n\n![image](1.png)\nFig.1: An example of a move in Wall Making Game.\n\nYour task is to write a program that determines which player wins the game if the two players play optimally from a given initial board.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input consists of two integers $H$ and $W$ $(1 \\leq H, W \\leq 20)$, where $H$ and $W$ are the height and the width of the board respectively. The following $H$ lines represent the initial board. Each of the $H$ lines consists of $W$ characters.\n\nThe $j$-th character of the $i$-th line is '.' if the cell at the $j$-th column of the $i$-th row is empty, or 'X' if the cell is marked.\n\nOutput\n\nPrint \"First\" (without the quotes) in a line if the first player wins the given game. Otherwise, print \"Second\" (also without the quotes) in a line.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n2 2\n..\n..\n\nOutput for the Sample Input 1\n\nSecond\nSample Input 2\n\n2 2\nX.\n..\n\nOutput for the Sample Input 2\n\nFirst\nSample Input 3\n\n4 5\nX....\n...X.\n.....\n.....\n\nOutput for the Sample Input 3\n\nFirst\n\nPlease use a python program to solve this problem\n\nexample_input:\n2 2\n..\n..\n\n\nexample_output:\nSecond\n\n",
