Since 'S' is in rectangle 4, rectangle 1 must contain 'P'.\n   * Rectangle 5 has 'P', 'I', 'M', and 'S'. Since 'S' is in rectangle 4, 'P' is in rectangle 1, and we need to use 'I', rectangle 5 must contain 'M'.\n   * Rectangle 3 has 'I' and 'P'. Since 'P' is in rectangle 1, and 'I' is not in rectangle 5, rectangle 3 must contain 'I'.\n   * This leaves 'R' for rectangle 2.\n\n4. **Determine the letter in rectangle 2:** Rectangle 2 must contain 'R'.\n\nTherefore, the letter Harry does not cross out in rectangle 2 is R.\n\n\\boxed{R}\n",
