To determine the correct answer, we need to identify the pattern and complete it.\n\n**Step 2: Identify the pattern**\n\nUpon closer inspection, it appears that each block consists of two smaller blocks stacked on top of each other. The orientation of these smaller blocks changes in a specific way from one block to the next.\n\n**Step 3: Determine the missing block**\n\nTo complete the pattern, we need to find the next block that follows the established sequence. Looking at the pattern, the first block has the smaller blocks aligned horizontally, the second block has them aligned vertically, the third block has them aligned at a 45-degree angle, and the fourth block has them aligned horizontally again.\n\n**Step 4: Choose the correct option**\n\nBased on the pattern, the missing block should have the smaller blocks aligned vertically. Among the options provided, only one matches this description.\n\n**Answer**: B",

To find out what these small polyhedrons are, we need to analyze the structure of the original polyhedron.\n\nLet's break down the problem step by step:\n\n1. The original polyhedron is composed of 18 cubes.\n2. We need to divide this polyhedron into 3 identical small polyhedrons.\n3. Since the small polyhedrons are identical, they must have the same number of cubes.\n\nNow, let's consider the possible ways to divide the original polyhedron into 3 identical small polyhedrons:\n\n*   Option 1: Divide the polyhedron into 3 cubes each.\n*   Option 2: Divide the polyhedron into 6 cubes each.\n*   Option 3: Divide the polyhedron into 9 cubes each.\n\nWe can eliminate Option 1 because it would result in only 3 cubes, which is not enough to form a polyhedron.\n\nWe can also eliminate Option 2 because it would result in 6 cubes, which is not a multiple of 3.\n\nTherefore, the only possible option is Option 3, where the polyhedron is divided into 9 cubes each.\n\nSo, the small polyhedrons cut into are **9-cube pyramids**.\n\n**Answer:** \\boxed{9-cube pyramids}",
