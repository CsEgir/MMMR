So, two diagonal lines are added.\n    3.  **Image 3:** Takes the structure from Image 2 and adds another L-shape inside, parallel to the original L-shape, connecting to the inner diagonal line. So, two perpendicular lines (forming an L-shape) are added.\n\n*   **Identify the rule:** The pattern alternates between adding a pair of parallel diagonal lines (closing the shape into a triangle shell) and adding a pair of perpendicular lines (forming an inner L-shape).\n    *   Step 1 -> 2: Add 2 diagonal lines.\n    *   Step 2 -> 3: Add 2 perpendicular lines (inner L-shape).\n    *   Step 3 -> 4: Following the pattern, we should add 2 diagonal lines inside the inner L-shape.\n\n*   **Apply the rule to find the next image:** Starting with Image 3, we need to add a diagonal line to close the inner L-shape into a smaller triangle, and then add another diagonal line parallel to it, further inside.\n\n*   **Evaluate the options:**\n    *   Option A: Adds only one diagonal line inside the inner L-shape.\n    *   Option B: Adds another L-shape inside, which would be the step *after* the next one.\n    *   Option C: Adds the diagonal line to close the inner L-shape and adds another parallel diagonal line inside that.

Try to mentally (or physically, if possible) place the four smaller figures within its boundary without rotating them.\n    *   The top-left portion of Figure B matches the first small figure.\n    *   The top-right portion of Figure B matches the second small figure.\n    *   The bottom-left portion of Figure B matches the third small figure.\n    *   The bottom-right portion of Figure B matches the fourth small figure.\n    *   Check the adjacent edges: The right edge of the first figure matches the left edge of the second figure.

The bottom edge of the second figure matches the top edge of the fourth figure. All pieces fit together perfectly without rotation or overlap, using only translation.\n*   **Analyze Figure C:** Figure C has inward-pointing corners (reflex angles). Look at the four small figures; they are all convex polygons (no inward-pointing corners). When convex polygons are placed side-by-side without overlap, the resulting combined shape generally does not have such sharp inward corners unless there are gaps, or the pieces are arranged in a very specific way. It's difficult to see how the four given convex shapes could form the specific indentations seen in C just by translation. For example, the sharp V-shape indentation in the middle right of C cannot be formed by the straight edges of the small figures meeting externally.\n*   **Analyze Figure D:** Figure D also has an inward-pointing corner on the right side. Similar to Figure C, it's hard to visualize how the four convex pieces, when translated, would form this specific shape. While combining shapes can create non-convex outlines, the specific outline of D doesn't seem to match the combination of the four pieces as naturally as Figure B does. The arrangement that forms Figure B is a straightforward 2x2 grid placement. Trying to arrange the pieces to form D would require a different configuration, and it's not apparent how it could be done without rotation or creating the specific angles seen in D.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Based on the visual inspection and fitting, Figure B is the only figure that is clearly composed of the four smaller figures using only translation (panning).\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{B}$",

Peter said: \"For every card on the table it is true that if there is a vowel on one side, there is an even number on the other side.\" What is the smallest number of cards Alice must turn in order to check whether Peter said the truth?\n<image1>\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",
            "output": "Let the statement be P -> Q, where P is \"the card has a vowel on one side\" and Q is \"the card has an even number on the other side\".\nThe statement Peter made is: \"For every card on the table, if there is a vowel on one side, there is an even number on the other side.\"\nWe need to check which cards could potentially violate this rule. A violation occurs if a card has a vowel on one side and an odd number on the other side.\n\nThe four cards visible are E, K, 4, 7.\nLet's analyze each card:\n\n1.  **Card E:** This card shows a vowel ('E'). According to the rule (P -> Q), if P is true (it has a vowel), then Q must be true (it must have an even number on the other side). To check if the rule holds for this card, we must turn it over to see if the number on the other side is even. If the number is odd, Peter's statement is false. So, we must turn over card E.\n\n2.  **Card K:** This card shows a consonant ('K'). The rule is \"If vowel, then even number\". Since this card does not have a vowel on the visible side (P is false), the implication P -> Q is true regardless of what is on the other side (whether Q is true or false). Therefore, this card cannot violate the rule, and we do not need to turn it over.\n\n3.  **Card 4:** This card shows an even number ('4'). The rule is \"If vowel, then even number\" (P -> Q). This card shows that Q is true (it has an even number). If Q is true, the implication P -> Q is true regardless of what is on the other side (whether P is true or false). If the other side is a vowel (P is true), the rule holds (Vowel -> Even). If the other side is a consonant (P is false), the rule also holds because the premise is false. Therefore, this card cannot violate the rule, and we do not need to turn it over.\n\n4.  **Card 7:** This card shows an odd number ('7'). The rule is \"If vowel, then even number\" (P -> Q). This card shows that the condition Q (even number) is false. For the implication P -> Q to be true when Q is false, P must also be false. This means the other side must *not* be a vowel (it must be a consonant). If the other side *is* a vowel (P is true), then we have a case of Vowel -> Odd, which violates the rule (P is true, but Q is false). Therefore, we must turn over card 7 to check if the letter on the other side is a vowel. If it is a vowel, Peter's statement is false.\n\nConclusion: To check if Peter's statement is true, Alice must turn over the cards that could potentially falsify the statement. These are the card showing a vowel (E) and the card showing an odd number (7).\nThe minimum number of cards Alice must turn is 2.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{2}$",
