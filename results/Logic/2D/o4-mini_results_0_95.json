Which letter does he not cross out in rectangle 2? Options: A. P, B. R, C. I, D. S, E. M\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",
            "output": "(\"To solve this problem, let's consider the goal: we need to cross out letters so that each rectangle contains only one letter, and each rectangle contains a different letter.\\n\\nLet\u2019s go step by step for each rectangle:\\n\\n1. **Rectangle 1** contains P and S. One of these will stay.\\n2. **Rectangle 2** contains P, I, S, and R. One of these will stay.\\n3. **Rectangle 3** contains I and P. One of these will stay.\\n4. **Rectangle 4** contains S. So, S is already the only letter in rectangle 4.\\n5. **Rectangle 5** contains P, M, R, I, and S. One of these will stay.\\n\\nSince each rectangle must contain a different letter, we can deduce the following:\\n\\n- From **Rectangle 4**, S must be the letter that stays because it is the only one present.\\n- From **Rectangle 5**, since S is already used in Rectangle 4, we can cross out S, leaving P, M, R, or I.\\n- From **Rectangle 3**, I or P must remain. Since P is used in Rectangle 1 and 2, I must be the letter that stays there.\\n- From **Rectangle 2**, P, I, S, or R must stay. Since I and S are already used, P must stay in Rectangle 2.\\n\\nTherefore, the letter that remains in **Rectangle 2** is **P**.\\n\\nThe final answer is:\\n\\n\\\\[\\n\\\\boxed{P}\\n\\\\]\", 16.007846355438232)",
