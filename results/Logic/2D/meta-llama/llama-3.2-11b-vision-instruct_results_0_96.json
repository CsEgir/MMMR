This means that the shapes in the cells of adjacent cards must match for them to be placed together.\n\nLooking at the figure, we can see that the shapes in the cells of the cards are arranged in a specific pattern. By examining this pattern, we can identify which card does not fit with the others based on the rule that adjacent cards must have matching shapes in their cells.\n\nUpon careful examination, it becomes clear that one of the cards does not meet this criterion.
