            "output": "*   **Analyze the sequence:** Observe the relationship between consecutive shapes. Each shape is composed of three identical cubes. Let's focus on the base (two cubes) and the top cube.\n*   **Identify the transformation:** Compare the first shape to the second. The first shape has a base of two cubes extending horizontally to the left from the cube with another cube on top. The second shape appears to be the first shape rotated 90 degrees clockwise around the vertical axis passing through the center of the rightmost base cube (the one with the cube on top).\n*   **Verify the pattern:**\n    *   Shape 1 to Shape 2: 90-degree clockwise rotation. The base moves from extending left to extending forward.\n    *   Shape 2 to Shape 3: 90-degree clockwise rotation. The base moves from extending forward to extending right.\n    *   Shape 3 to Shape 4: 90-degree clockwise rotation. The base moves from extending right to extending backward.\n    *   Shape 4 to Shape 5: 90-degree clockwise rotation. The base moves from extending backward to extending left. Notice that Shape 5 is identical in orientation to Shape 1.\n*   **Predict the next shape:** Since the pattern is a 90-degree clockwise rotation and Shape 5 is the same as Shape 1, the next shape (Shape 6) should be the result of rotating Shape 5 (or Shape 1) by 90 degrees clockwise. This means Shape 6 should be identical in orientation to Shape 2.\n*   **Compare with options:** Look for the option that matches the orientation of Shape 2. Shape 2 has the base extending forward (towards the viewer) from the cube with the top cube.\n    *   Option A is incorrect (only two cubes).\n    *   Option B matches Shape 3.\n    *   Option C matches Shape 2.\n    *   Option D matches Shape 4.\n*   **Conclusion:** The correct shape to fill the question mark is the one identical to Shape 2, which is Option C.\n\n\\boxed{C}",

It has several cutouts and protrusions.\n*   **Examine Option A (Front View):** Looking at the solid from the front (the face with the step cutout on the left), we see the main rectangular body, the step cutout on the lower left, the square block on the upper left, and the cylinder on the upper right (which appears as a rectangle from the front). Option A matches this description.\n*   **Examine Option C (Top View):** Looking down from the top, we see the overall shape. In the back-left corner (top-left in the 2D view), there's the square block. In the back-right corner (top-right in the 2D view), there's the cylinder (appearing as a circle). In the front-left area (bottom-left in the 2D view), we see the top surface of the lower part resulting from the front step cutout. In the front-right area (bottom-right in the 2D view), we see the top surface of the lower part resulting from the right-side step cutout. The central cutout is also visible. Option C accurately represents this top view.\n*   **Examine Option B (Right-Side View):** Looking from the right side, we see the main profile. There's a step cutout at the bottom-front (bottom-right in the 2D view). The cylinder is visible on the top-back (top-left in the 2D view). The square block is behind the cylinder (partially visible or indicated by lines). The central cutout and the front step cutout create internal lines and affect the profile. Option B matches this right-side view, showing the outline and internal edges.\n*   **Examine Option D:** This view shows a square with a concave curved cutout in one corner. The original solid figure consists of straight edges and flat faces, with the exception of the cylinder. None of the standard orthographic views (front, back, left, right, top, bottom) would result in a simple square shape with a single curved cutout like this. The cylinder appears as a circle from the top (as in C) and a rectangle from the sides/front/back (as in A). The cutouts are all rectangular. Therefore, view D cannot be obtained from the given solid.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{D}$",

            "output": "*   **Analysis of the 3D Figure:** The figure consists of two parts:\n    1.  A larger cylinder with a cylindrical hole through its center (a hollow cylinder or thick-walled tube).\n    2.  A smaller solid cylinder placed on top of the larger one, centered over the hole.\n\n*   **Analyzing Possible Cross-Sections:** We need to consider cuts made by planes from different angles.\n\n    *   **Horizontal Cut:**\n        *   If the cut is made through the top (smaller) solid cylinder, the cross-section is a solid circle.\n        *   If the cut is made through the bottom (larger) hollow cylinder, the cross-section is an annulus (a ring shape, the area between two concentric circles).\n\n    *   **Vertical Cut:**\n        *   If the cut passes through the central axis of both cylinders: The top cylinder gives a rectangle. The bottom hollow cylinder gives two identical rectangles separated by a gap (representing the hollow part). Combined, this forms shape **B**.\n        *   If the cut passes through the bottom hollow cylinder but is off-center (it still cuts through the hollow space): The plane intersects the outer cylindrical wall, the inner cylindrical wall, and the top and bottom annular faces. The intersection with the walls gives vertical line segments. The intersection with the top and bottom faces gives arcs. This results in a shape like **D**, which is bounded by two concentric arcs on the top and bottom and two vertical lines on the sides.\n        *   If the vertical cut only passes through the solid part of the bottom cylinder (missing the hole), it would be a rectangle. If it passes through the bottom cylinder and misses the top cylinder entirely, it could be shape D or a simple rectangle.\n\n    *   **Oblique Cut (Tilted Plane):**\n        *   An oblique cut through a solid cylinder results in an ellipse.\n        *   An oblique cut through a hollow cylinder results in a shape bounded by ellipses (an \"elliptical annulus\").\n        *   Consider a plane cutting obliquely near the junction between the top and bottom cylinders. It might cut through the side/base of the top cylinder (giving part of an ellipse) and the top annular face of the bottom cylinder (giving part of an elliptical annulus). Shape **C** appears to be a plausible result of such an oblique cut, showing the intersection of an ellipse (from the top cylinder) and an elliptical annulus (from the top face of the bottom cylinder).\n\n*   **Evaluating Option A:** Shape A shows three concentric circles, forming a central solid circle surrounded by an annulus.\n    *   A horizontal cut can only produce a single solid circle (from the top part) or an annulus (two concentric circles, from the bottom part).\n    *   No single planar cut (horizontal, vertical, or oblique) can intersect this object to produce three distinct concentric circles simultaneously. A plane intersects a cylinder or annulus to form circles, ellipses, rectangles, or segments/combinations of these, but not three concentric circles.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Shapes B, C, and D can be obtained as cross-sections through appropriate cuts. Shape A cannot be obtained as a cross-section of the given figure.\n\nThe final",

From the middle cube of the central column, one cube extends to the right.\n\n*   **Analyze Figure A:** This figure has a 3-cube vertical column. A cube extends to the left at the top and a cube extends to the right at the bottom. This structure is different from the original (original has T-shape on top and extension from the middle cube). Figure A is not a rotation.\n\n*   **Analyze Figure B:** This figure has a 3-cube vertical column. At the top, cubes extend to the left and right (T-shape). From the middle cube of the column, a cube extends to the *left*. Let's see if this can be obtained by rotating the original. If we rotate the original object 180 degrees around the vertical axis passing through the center of the 3-cube column, the T-shape at the top remains oriented the same way relative to the column, but the cube extending to the right from the middle cube will now extend to the left. This matches Figure B.\n\n*   **Analyze Figure C:** This figure has a 3-cube vertical column. It has a T-shape at the top. A cube extends to the right, but it extends from the *bottom* cube of the column, not the middle cube as in the original. Figure C is not a rotation.\n\n*   **Analyze Figure D:** This figure's structure is different. It looks like a 2x2 block on the right with an L-shape attached to the left. It doesn't have the clear 3-cube vertical column with a T-top like the original. Figure D is not a rotation.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** Figure B is the only figure that can be obtained by rotating the original object.\n\n\\\\boxed{B}",
