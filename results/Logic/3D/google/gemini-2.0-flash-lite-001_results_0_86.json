In option D, the heart and the circle are next to each other, and the cross is next to the circle. The star is next to the circle. This is a possible configuration.\n\nLet's analyze the relative positions of the faces.\nIn Figure 1, the heart is next to the arrow and the circle.\nIn Figure 2, the circle is next to the cross and the star.\n\nIn option A, the heart is next to the circle. The arrow is next to the circle. The cross is next to the circle. This is possible.\nIn option B, the heart is next to the circle. The arrow is next to the circle. The cross is next to the circle. This is possible.\nIn option C, the heart is next to the arrow. The circle is next to the arrow. The cross is next to the circle. This is possible.\nIn option D, the heart is next to the circle. The arrow is next to the circle. The cross is next to the circle. This is possible.\n\nLet's consider the relative positions of the heart, circle, and arrow. In the original cube, the heart, circle, and arrow are adjacent. In option D, the heart and circle are adjacent, and the circle is adjacent to the cross. The star is adjacent to the circle. This is a possible configuration.\n\nLet's analyze option C. The heart is next to the arrow. The circle is next to the arrow. The cross is next to the circle. This is a possible configuration.\n\nLet's analyze option B. The heart is next to the circle. The arrow is next to the circle. The cross is next to the circle. This is a possible configuration.\n\nLet's analyze option A. The heart is next to the circle. The arrow is next to the circle. The cross is next to the circle. This is a possible configuration.\n\nAll options seem possible. However, let's consider the relative positions of the faces. In the original cube, the heart, circle, and arrow are adjacent. In option D, the heart and circle are adjacent, and the circle is adjacent to the cross. The star is adjacent to the circle. This is a possible configuration.\n\nLet's analyze option C.

The cross is next to the circle. This is a possible configuration.\n\nUpon closer inspection, in option C, the heart is opposite the star. In the original cube, the heart and star are not opposite each other. Therefore, option C is incorrect.\n\n\\boxed{C}\n",
