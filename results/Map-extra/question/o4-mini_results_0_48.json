Using the equation for distance under constant acceleration:\\n\\n$$ d = v_0 t + \\\\frac{1}{2} a t^2 $$\\n\\nSubstituting the values:\\n\\n$$ d = 15 \\\\times 5 + \\\\frac{1}{2} \\\\times (-1) \\\\times (5)^2 $$\\n$$ d = 75 - 12.5 = 62.5 \\\\, \\\\text{meters} $$\\n\\nSo, the white sedan covers a distance of 62.5 meters during the 5 seconds of deceleration.\\n\\n### Step 2: Calculate the distance the autonomous vehicle will travel during the same period\\n- Initial speed of the autonomous vehicle: \\\\( 15 \\\\, \\\\text{m/s} \\\\) (same as the white sedan\u2019s initial speed)\\n- The autonomous vehicle will not decelerate for the first 2 seconds, so during the first 2 seconds, it will travel at the same speed, which is 15 m/s.\\n\\nThus, the distance traveled by the autonomous vehicle in the first 2 seconds:\\n\\n$$ d_{\\\\text{initial}} = 15 \\\\times 2 = 30 \\\\, \\\\text{meters} $$\\n\\nAfter the 2-second delay, the autonomous vehicle will start decelerating.
