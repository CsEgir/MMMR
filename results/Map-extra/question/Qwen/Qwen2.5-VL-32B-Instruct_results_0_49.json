            "question": "A self-driving vehicle is currently positioned as shown in the image. From this point, it will continue straight until it reaches the next intersection, where it will make a right turn. After completing the turn, it will drive forward and perform a U-turn at the following intersection. Once the U-turn is completed, the vehicle will continue along the same road and stop at a designated drop-off location located directly beside the third streetlight pole on the right-hand side. Each road segment between intersections measures approximately 60 meters from centerline to centerline, and the streetlight poles are evenly spaced at 15-meter intervals along the sidewalk. The vehicle maintains a constant speed of 54 km/h while driving straight and slows down to 36 km/h for both the right turn and U-turn maneuvers. Assuming smooth transitions with no traffic lights or stop signs affecting the route, how much time, in seconds, will the vehicle take to reach the drop-off point?\n\nA. 16.2 seconds\nB. 20.4 seconds\nC. 24.6 seconds\nD. 28.8 seconds\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",
