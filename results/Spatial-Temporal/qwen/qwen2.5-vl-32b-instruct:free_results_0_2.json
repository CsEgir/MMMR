            "output": "To determine the number of yellow cars present in the given images, let's analyze the provided image step by step:\n\n1. **Image Description**: The image shows a road with road signs indicating directions to Kent Ridge Rd, Stockport Rd, and Pasir Panjang Rd. There is also a sign for the National Community Leadership Institute (NACLI). The road has yellow markings, but no cars are visible in the image.\n\n2. **Presence of Cars**: Upon careful observation, there are no cars visible in the image. The road appears to be empty, and there are no yellow cars present.\n\n3. **Conclusion**: Since there are no cars in the image, the number of yellow cars is zero.\n\nGiven the options provided:\n- A. three\n- B.
