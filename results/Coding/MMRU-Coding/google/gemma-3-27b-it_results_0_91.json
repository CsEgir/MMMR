These histograms are semi-transparent (`alpha=0.3`) and use density=True, meaning they represent probability densities. The x-axis histograms are vertical, and the y-axis histograms are horizontal.\n*   **Lines:** Horizontal and vertical dashed lines are added at y=0.5 and x=0, respectively.\n*   **Labels and Title:** The axes are labeled with specific mathematical expressions, and a legend is included to distinguish between the two classes.\n*   **Text:** The text \"\u03b1\u2081\" and \"\u03b1\u2082\" are added at specific coordinates.\n*   **Limits:** The x and y axes limits are set to (-0.1, 1.1) and (-1.1, 1.1) respectively.\n\nTherefore, the visualization is a scatter plot of two classes of points with overlaid histograms representing the distributions of each class along both axes, and with additional lines and text annotations.\n\n\\boxed{Scatter plot with overlaid histograms}",

            "output": "The code generates a grid of horizontal bar charts. Let's break down the code to understand the visualization:\n\n1.  **Data Generation:** `data = np.random.randint(50, 150, (8, 5, 5))` creates a 3D NumPy array with dimensions 8x5x5. This array holds random integer values between 50 and 150. The first dimension (8) represents the categories, the second dimension (5) represents the levels, and the third dimension (5) is likely used for the different colors in the bars.\n\n2.  **Subplots:** `fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=3, ncols=3, figsize=(12, 10))` creates a figure and a 3x3 grid of subplots. `axes = axes.flatten()` converts the 2D array of axes into a 1D array for easier iteration.\n\n3.  **Looping and Bar Chart Creation:** The nested loops iterate through the categories and levels. Inside the loop, `ax.barh(level, data[i, j], color=colors, edgecolor='black', left=np.sum(data[i, :j], axis=0))` creates a horizontal bar chart for each category and level.\n    *   `level` is used as the y-axis values.\n    *   `data[i, j]` provides the height of the bar.\n    *   `color=colors` assigns colors to the bars.\n    *   `edgecolor='black'` adds black borders to the bars.\n    *   `left=np.sum(data[i, :j], axis=0)` is crucial. It calculates the cumulative sum of the data up to the current level (`j`) for each category (`i`). This means that each bar is positioned to the right of the previous bar in the same category, creating a stacked horizontal bar chart.\n\n4.  **Titles and Limits:** `ax.set_title(categories[i])` sets the title of each subplot to the corresponding category name. `ax.set_xlim(0, 500)` sets the x-axis limits to 0-500.\n\n5.  **Removing Last Subplot:** `fig.delaxes(axes[-1])` removes the last subplot from the grid, leaving a 3x3 grid with 8 subplots.\n\n6.  **Legend:** `fig.legend(['HC', 'H', 'N', 'L', 'LC'], loc='lower center', ncol=5, bbox_to_anchor=(0.5, -0.05))` adds a legend to the figure, mapping the colors to the labels 'HC', 'H', 'N', 'L', and 'LC'.\n\n7.  **Layout and Display:** `plt.tight_layout()` adjusts the subplot parameters to provide reasonable spacing between the plots. `plt.show()` displays the figure.\n\nIn summary, the code generates a 3x3 grid of stacked horizontal bar charts, where each chart represents a category (e.g., \"Current smoking\"). The bars within each chart represent the levels (\"1 - most disadvantaged\" to \"5 - least disadvantaged\"), and the height of each bar segment corresponds to the random data value. The legend explains the color coding for each level.\n\n\\boxed{Stacked horizontal bar charts showing the distribution of levels for each category}",

The last subplot is removed, and the x-axis is limited to 0-500.\n\n\\boxed{A 3x3 grid of horizontal bar charts, each representing a health risk category and showing values for different socioeconomic levels, with a legend explaining the color scheme.}",

The function is `Z = exp(-A * k / 100)`. This function decreases as either `A` or `k` increases.\n4.  `norm = plt.Normalize(Z.min(), Z.max())`: This line normalizes the Z-values to the range \\[0, 1].\n5.  `colors = cm.viridis(norm(Z))`: This line maps the normalized Z-values to colors using the 'viridis' colormap.\n6.  `fig = plt.figure()` and `ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')`: These lines create a 3D subplot.\n7.  `surf = ax.plot_surface(k, A, Z, facecolors=colors, rstride=5, cstride=5, linewidth=0.5, shade=False)`: This line creates the 3D surface plot. `k` is the x-axis, `A` is the y-axis, and `Z` is the z-axis. The `facecolors` argument specifies the colors for each face of the surface. `rstride` and `cstride` control the sampling rate of the surface. `linewidth` sets the width of the lines, and `shade=False` disables shading.\n8.  `surf.set_facecolor((0, 0, 0, 0))`: This line sets the face color of the surface to transparent.\n9.  `ax.set_xlabel(r'$k$')`, `ax.set_ylabel(r'$|A|$')`, and `ax.set_zlabel('Value')`: These lines set the labels for the x, y, and z axes.\n10. `plt.show()`: This line displays the plot.\n\nThe resulting plot will be a 3D surface that starts at a maximum value of 1 at (0, 0) and decreases exponentially as either `k` or `A` increases. The surface will be colored according to the 'viridis' colormap, with higher Z-values corresponding to warmer colors (e.g., yellow) and lower Z-values corresponding to cooler colors (e.g., purple). The surface will be transparent.\n\nBased on this analysis, the most appropriate visualization is the first image, which shows a 3D surface plot with the described characteristics.\n\n\\boxed{answer}",

            "question": "'Twas the night before Christmas, and Santa's frantically setting up his new Christmas tree! There are $$$n$$$ nodes in the tree, connected by $$$n-1$$$ edges. On each edge of the tree, there's a set of Christmas lights, which can be represented by an integer in binary representation.\n ![image](1.png) He has $$$m$$$ elves come over and admire his tree. Each elf is assigned two nodes, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, and that elf looks at all lights on the simple path between the two nodes. After this, the elf's favorite number becomes the bitwise XOR of the values of the lights on the edges in that path.\nHowever, the North Pole has been recovering from a nasty bout of flu. Because of this, Santa forgot some of the configurations of lights he had put on the tree, and he has already left the North Pole! Fortunately, the elves came to the rescue, and each one told Santa what pair of nodes he was assigned $$$(a_i, b_i)$$$, as well as the parity of the number of set bits in his favorite number. In other words, he remembers whether the number of $$$1$$$'s when his favorite number is written in binary is odd or even.\nHelp Santa determine if it's possible that the memories are consistent, and if it is, remember what his tree looked like, and maybe you'll go down in history!\n\nInput\nThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^4$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. Then $$$t$$$ cases follow.\nThe first line of each test case contains two integers, $$$n$$$ and $$$m$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$; $$$1 \\leq m \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the size of tree and the number of elves respectively.\nThe next $$$n-1$$$ lines of each test case each contains three integers, $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\leq x, y \\leq n$$$; $$$-1 \\leq v < 2^{30}$$$)\u00a0\u2014 meaning that there's an edge between nodes $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$. If \n -  $$$v = -1$$$: Santa doesn't remember what the set of lights were on for this edge. -  $$$v \\geq 0$$$: The set of lights on the edge is $$$v$$$. The next $$$m$$$ lines of each test case each contains three integers, $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$, and $$$p$$$ ($$$1 \\leq a, b \\leq n$$$; $$$a \\neq b$$$; $$$0 \\leq p \\leq 1$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the nodes that the elf was assigned to, and the parity of the number of set bits in the elf's favorite number.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of all $$$n$$$ and the sum of all $$$m$$$ don't exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$ each.\nIt is guaranteed that the given edges form a tree.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, first print either YES or NO (in any case), whether there's a tree consistent with Santa's memory or not. \nIf the answer is YES, print $$$n-1$$$ lines each containing three integers: $$$x$$$, $$$y$$$, and $$$v$$$ ($$$1 \\le x, y \\le n$$$; $$$0 \\le v < 2^{30}$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the edge and the integer on that edge. The set of edges must be the same as in the input, and if the value of some edge was specified earlier, it can not change. You can print the edges in any order.\nIf there are multiple answers, print any.\n\nExample\nInput\n4\n6 5\n1 2 -1\n1 3 1\n4 2 7\n6 3 0\n2 5 -1\n2 3 1\n2 5 0\n5 6 1\n6 1 1\n4 5 1\n5 3\n1 2 -1\n1 3 -1\n1 4 1\n4 5 -1\n2 4 0\n3 4 1\n2 3 1\n3 3\n1 2 -1\n1 3 -1\n1 2 0\n1 3 1\n2 3 0\n2 1\n1 2 1\n1 2 0\n\n\nOutput\nYES\n1 2 0\n1 3 1\n2 4 7\n3 6 0\n2 5 0\nYES\n1 2 1\n1 3 0\n1 4 1\n4 5 1\nNO\nNO\n\n\n\n\nNote\nThe first test case is the image in the statement.\nOne possible answer is assigning the value of the edge $$$(1, 2)$$$ to $$$5$$$, and the value of the edge $$$(2, 5)$$$ to $$$3$$$. This is correct because: \n -  The first elf goes from node $$$2$$$ to node $$$3$$$. This elf's favorite number is $$$4$$$, so he remembers the value $$$1$$$ (as $$$4$$$ has an odd number of $$$1$$$ bits in its binary representation). -  The second elf goes from node $$$2$$$ to node $$$5$$$. This elf's favorite number is $$$3$$$, so he remembers the value $$$0$$$ (as $$$3$$$ has an even number of $$$1$$$ bits in its binary representation). -  The third elf goes from node $$$5$$$ to node $$$6$$$. This elf's favorite number is $$$7$$$, so he remembers the value $$$1$$$ (as $$$7$$$ has an odd number of $$$1$$$ bits in its binary representation). -  The fourth elf goes from node $$$6$$$ to node $$$1$$$. This elf's favorite number is $$$1$$$, so he remembers the value $$$1$$$ (as $$$1$$$ has an odd number of $$$1$$$ bits in its binary representation). -  The fifth elf goes from node $$$4$$$ to node $$$5$$$. This elf's favorite number is $$$4$$$, so he remembers the number $$$1$$$ (as $$$4$$$ has an odd number of $$$1$$$ bits in its binary representation).

            "question": "In this problem you have to implement an algorithm to defragment your hard disk. The hard disk consists of a sequence of clusters, numbered by integers from 1 to n. The disk has m recorded files, the i-th file occupies clusters with numbers a_{i,\u20091}, a_{i,\u20092}, ..., a_{i,\u2009ni}. These clusters are not necessarily located consecutively on the disk, but the order in which they are given corresponds to their sequence in the file (cluster a_{i,\u20091} contains the first fragment of the i-th file, cluster a_{i,\u20092} has the second fragment, etc.). Also the disc must have one or several clusters which are free from files.\nYou are permitted to perform operations of copying the contents of cluster number i to cluster number j (i and j must be different). Moreover, if the cluster number j used to keep some information, it is lost forever. Clusters are not cleaned, but after the defragmentation is complete, some of them are simply declared unusable (although they may possibly still contain some fragments of files).\nYour task is to use a sequence of copy operations to ensure that each file occupies a contiguous area of memory. Each file should occupy a consecutive cluster section, the files must follow one after another from the beginning of the hard disk. After defragmentation all free (unused) clusters should be at the end of the hard disk. After defragmenting files can be placed in an arbitrary order. Clusters of each file should go consecutively from first to last. See explanatory examples in the notes.\nPrint the sequence of operations leading to the disk defragmentation. Note that you do not have to minimize the number of operations, but it should not exceed 2n.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n,\u2009m\u2009\u2264\u2009200) \u2014 the number of clusters and the number of files, correspondingly. Next m lines contain descriptions of the files. The first number in the line is n_{i} (n_{i}\u2009\u2265\u20091), the number of clusters occupied by the i-th file. Then follow n_{i} numbers a_{i,\u20091}, a_{i,\u20092}, ..., a_{i,\u2009ni} (1\u2009\u2264\u2009a_{i,\u2009j}\u2009\u2264\u2009n). It is guaranteed that each cluster number occurs not more than once and ![image](1.png), that is, there exists at least one unused cluster. Numbers on each line are separated by spaces. \n\nOutput\nIn the first line print a single integer k (0\u2009\u2264\u2009k\u2009\u2264\u20092n) \u2014 the number of operations needed to defragment the disk. Next k lines should contain the operations' descriptions as \"i j\" (copy the contents of the cluster number i to the cluster number j). \n\nExamples\nInput\n7 2\n2 1 2\n3 3 4 5\n\n\nOutput\n0\n\n\nInput\n7 2\n2 1 3\n3 2 4 5\n\n\nOutput\n3\n2 6\n3 2\n6 3\n\n\n\n\nNote\nLet's say that a disk consists of 8 clusters and contains two files. The first file occupies two clusters and the second file occupies three clusters. Let's look at examples of correct and incorrect positions of files after defragmentation. \n![image](2.png)Example 2: each file must occupy a contiguous area of memory.\nExample 3: the order of files to each other is not important, at first the second file can be written, and then \u2014 the first one.\nExample 4: violating the order of file fragments to each other is not allowed.\nExample 5: unused clusters should be located at the end, and in this example the unused clusters are 3, 7, 8.\n\n\n\nPlease use a python program to solve this problem\n\nexample_input:\n7 3\n1 7\n2 6 5\n3 4 3 2\n\n\nexample_output:\n7\n7 1\n2 7\n6 2\n3 6\n5 3\n6 5\n7 6\n\n\nTime limit:\n1 second\n\nMemory limit:\n256 megabytes\n\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

Let's enumerate them in a clockwise direction as $$$p_1$$$, $$$p_2$$$, ..., $$$p_n$$$ (all these numbers are from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$ and are distinct, so $$$p$$$ is a permutation). Let the next kid for a kid $$$p_i$$$ be kid $$$p_{i + 1}$$$ if $$$i < n$$$ and $$$p_1$$$ otherwise. After the dance, each kid remembered two kids: the next kid (let's call him $$$x$$$) and the next kid for $$$x$$$. Each kid told you which kids he/she remembered: the kid $$$i$$$ remembered kids $$$a_{i, 1}$$$ and $$$a_{i, 2}$$$. However, the order of $$$a_{i, 1}$$$ and $$$a_{i, 2}$$$ can differ from their order in the circle.\n ![image](1.png) Example: 5 kids in a circle, $$$p=[3, 2, 4, 1, 5]$$$ (or any cyclic shift). The information kids remembered is: $$$a_{1,1}=3$$$, $$$a_{1,2}=5$$$; $$$a_{2,1}=1$$$, $$$a_{2,2}=4$$$; $$$a_{3,1}=2$$$, $$$a_{3,2}=4$$$; $$$a_{4,1}=1$$$, $$$a_{4,2}=5$$$; $$$a_{5,1}=2$$$, $$$a_{5,2}=3$$$. You have to restore the order of the kids in the circle using this information. If there are several answers, you may print any. It is guaranteed that at least one solution exists.\nIf you are Python programmer, consider using PyPy instead of Python when you submit your code.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$3 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$) \u2014 the number of the kids.\nThe next $$$n$$$ lines contain $$$2$$$ integers each. The $$$i$$$-th line contains two integers $$$a_{i, 1}$$$ and $$$a_{i, 2}$$$ ($$$1 \\le a_{i, 1}, a_{i, 2} \\le n, a_{i, 1} \\ne a_{i, 2}$$$) \u2014 the kids the $$$i$$$-th kid remembered, given in arbitrary order.\n\nOutput\nPrint $$$n$$$ integers $$$p_1$$$, $$$p_2$$$, ..., $$$p_n$$$ \u2014 permutation of integers from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, which corresponds to the order of kids in the circle. If there are several answers, you may print any (for example, it doesn't matter which kid is the first in the circle).

            "question": "Alice lives on a flat planet that can be modeled as a square grid of size $$$n \\times n$$$, with rows and columns enumerated from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$. We represent the cell at the intersection of row $$$r$$$ and column $$$c$$$ with ordered pair $$$(r, c)$$$. Each cell in the grid is either land or water.\n ![image](1.png) An example planet with $$$n = 5$$$. It also appears in the first sample test. Alice resides in land cell $$$(r_1, c_1)$$$. She wishes to travel to land cell $$$(r_2, c_2)$$$. At any moment, she may move to one of the cells adjacent to where she is\u2014in one of the four directions (i.e., up, down, left, or right).\nUnfortunately, Alice cannot swim, and there is no viable transportation means other than by foot (i.e., she can walk only on land). As a result, Alice's trip may be impossible.\nTo help Alice, you plan to create at most one tunnel between some two land cells. The tunnel will allow Alice to freely travel between the two endpoints. Indeed, creating a tunnel is a lot of effort: the cost of creating a tunnel between cells $$$(r_s, c_s)$$$ and $$$(r_t, c_t)$$$ is $$$(r_s-r_t)^2 + (c_s-c_t)^2$$$.\nFor now, your task is to find the minimum possible cost of creating at most one tunnel so that Alice could travel from $$$(r_1, c_1)$$$ to $$$(r_2, c_2)$$$. If no tunnel needs to be created, the cost is $$$0$$$.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 50$$$) \u2014 the width of the square grid.\nThe second line contains two space-separated integers $$$r_1$$$ and $$$c_1$$$ ($$$1 \\leq r_1, c_1 \\leq n$$$) \u2014 denoting the cell where Alice resides.\nThe third line contains two space-separated integers $$$r_2$$$ and $$$c_2$$$ ($$$1 \\leq r_2, c_2 \\leq n$$$) \u2014 denoting the cell to which Alice wishes to travel.\nEach of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains a string of $$$n$$$ characters. The $$$j$$$-th character of the $$$i$$$-th such line ($$$1 \\leq i, j \\leq n$$$) is 0 if $$$(i, j)$$$ is land or 1 if $$$(i, j)$$$ is water.\nIt is guaranteed that $$$(r_1, c_1)$$$ and $$$(r_2, c_2)$$$ are land.\n\nOutput\nPrint an integer that is the minimum possible cost of creating at most one tunnel so that Alice could travel from $$$(r_1, c_1)$$$ to $$$(r_2, c_2)$$$.\n\nExamples\nInput\n5\n1 1\n5 5\n00001\n11111\n00111\n00110\n00110\n\n\nOutput\n10\n\n\nInput\n3\n1 3\n3 1\n010\n101\n010\n\n\nOutput\n8\n\n\n\n\nNote\nIn the first sample, a tunnel between cells $$$(1, 4)$$$ and $$$(4, 5)$$$ should be created. The cost of doing so is $$$(1-4)^2 + (4-5)^2 = 10$$$, which is optimal. This way, Alice could walk from $$$(1, 1)$$$ to $$$(1, 4)$$$, use the tunnel from $$$(1, 4)$$$ to $$$(4, 5)$$$, and lastly walk from $$$(4, 5)$$$ to $$$(5, 5)$$$.\nIn the second sample, clearly a tunnel between cells $$$(1, 3)$$$ and $$$(3, 1)$$$ needs to be created. The cost of doing so is $$$(1-3)^2 + (3-1)^2 = 8$$$.\n\n\n\nPlease use a python program to solve this problem\n\nexample_input:\n5\n1 1\n5 5\n00001\n11111\n00111\n00110\n00110\n\n\nexample_output:\n10\n\n\nTime limit:\n1 second\n\nMemory limit:\n256 megabytes\n\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "This week Arkady wanted to cook some pancakes (to follow ancient traditions) and make a problem about that. But then he remembered that one can't make a problem about stacking pancakes without working at a specific IT company, so he decided to bake the Napoleon cake instead.\nTo bake a Napoleon cake, one has to bake $$$n$$$ dry layers first, and then put them on each other in one stack, adding some cream. Arkady started with an empty plate, and performed the following steps $$$n$$$ times: \n -  place a new cake layer on the top of the stack; -  after the $$$i$$$-th layer is placed, pour $$$a_i$$$ units of cream on top of the stack. When $$$x$$$ units of cream are poured on the top of the stack, top $$$x$$$ layers of the cake get drenched in the cream. If there are less than $$$x$$$ layers, all layers get drenched and the rest of the cream is wasted. If $$$x = 0$$$, no layer gets drenched.\n ![image](1.png) The picture represents the first test case of the example. Help Arkady determine which layers of the cake eventually get drenched when the process is over, and which don't.\n\nInput\nEach test contains multiple test cases. The first line contains the number of test cases $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\le t \\le 20\\,000$$$). Description of the test cases follows.\nThe first line of each test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 2 \\cdot 10^5$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of layers in the cake.\nThe second line of each test case contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\le a_i \\le n$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the amount of cream poured on the cake after adding each layer.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases does not exceed $$$2 \\cdot 10^5$$$.\n\nOutput\nFor each test case, print a single line with $$$n$$$ integers. The $$$i$$$-th of the integers should be equal to $$$1$$$ if the $$$i$$$-th layer from the bottom gets drenched, and $$$0$$$ otherwise.\n\nExample\nInput\n3\n6\n0 3 0 0 1 3\n10\n0 0 0 1 0 5 0 0 0 2\n3\n0 0 0\n\n\nOutput\n1 1 0 1 1 1 \n0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 \n0 0 0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlease use a python program to solve this problem\n\nexample_input:\n3\n6\n0 3 0 0 1 3\n10\n0 0 0 1 0 5 0 0 0 2\n3\n0 0 0\n\n\nexample_output:\n1 1 0 1 1 1 \n0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 \n0 0 0 \n\n\nTime limit:\n1 second\n\nMemory limit:\n256 megabytes\n\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": " Denis was very sad after Nastya rejected him. So he decided to walk through the gateways to have some fun. And luck smiled at him! When he entered the first courtyard, he met a strange man who was selling something. \nDenis bought a mysterious item and it was... Random permutation generator! Denis could not believed his luck.\nWhen he arrived home, he began to study how his generator works and learned the algorithm. The process of generating a permutation consists of $$$n$$$ steps. At the $$$i$$$-th step, a place is chosen for the number $$$i$$$ $$$(1 \\leq i \\leq n)$$$. The position for the number $$$i$$$ is defined as follows:\n -  For all $$$j$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, we calculate $$$r_j$$$ \u00a0\u2014 the minimum index such that $$$j \\leq r_j \\leq n$$$, and the position $$$r_j$$$ is not yet occupied in the permutation. If there are no such positions, then we assume that the value of $$$r_j$$$ is not defined. -  For all $$$t$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, we calculate $$$count_t$$$ \u00a0\u2014 the number of positions $$$1 \\leq j \\leq n$$$ such that $$$r_j$$$ is defined and $$$r_j = t$$$. -  Consider the positions that are still not occupied by permutation and among those we consider the positions for which the value in the $$$count$$$ array is maximum. -  The generator selects one of these positions for the number $$$i$$$. The generator can choose any position. Let's have a look at the operation of the algorithm in the following example:\n ![image](1.png) Let $$$n = 5$$$ and the algorithm has already arranged the numbers $$$1, 2, 3$$$ in the permutation. Consider how the generator will choose a position for the number $$$4$$$:\n -  The values of $$$r$$$ will be $$$r = [3, 3, 3, 4, \\times]$$$, where $$$\\times$$$ means an indefinite value. -  Then the $$$count$$$ values will be $$$count = [0, 0, 3, 1, 0]$$$. -  There are only two unoccupied positions in the permutation: $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$. The value in the $$$count$$$ array for position $$$3$$$ is $$$3$$$, for position $$$4$$$ it is $$$1$$$. -  The maximum value is reached only for position $$$3$$$, so the algorithm will uniquely select this position for number $$$4$$$. Satisfied with his purchase, Denis went home. For several days without a break, he generated permutations. He believes that he can come up with random permutations no worse than a generator. After that, he wrote out the first permutation that came to mind $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ and decided to find out if it could be obtained as a result of the generator.\nUnfortunately, this task was too difficult for him, and he asked you for help. It is necessary to define whether the written permutation could be obtained using the described algorithm if the generator always selects the position Denis needs.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\leq t \\leq 10^5)$$$ \u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.\nThe first line of the test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5)$$$ \u00a0\u2014 the size of the permutation.\nThe second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ different integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq p_i \\leq n$$$) \u00a0\u2014 the permutation written by Denis.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.\n\nOutput\nPrint \"Yes\" if this permutation could be obtained as a result of the generator. Otherwise, print \"No\".\nAll letters can be displayed in any case.\n\nExample\nInput\n5\n5\n2 3 4 5 1\n1\n1\n3\n1 3 2\n4\n4 2 3 1\n5\n1 5 2 4 3\n\n\nOutput\nYes\nYes\nNo\nYes\nNo\n\n\n\n\nNote\nLet's simulate the operation of the generator in the first test.\nAt the $$$1$$$ step, $$$r = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], count = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$$$. The maximum value is reached in any free position, so the generator can choose a random position from $$$1$$$ to $$$5$$$. In our example, it chose $$$5$$$.\nAt the $$$2$$$ step, $$$r = [1, 2, 3, 4, \\times], count = [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]$$$. The maximum value is reached in positions from $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$, so the generator can choose a random position among them. In our example, it chose $$$1$$$.\nAt the $$$3$$$ step, $$$r = [2, 2, 3, 4, \\times], count = [0, 2, 1, 1, 0]$$$. The maximum value is $$$2$$$ and is reached only at the $$$2$$$ position, so the generator will choose this position.\nAt the $$$4$$$ step, $$$r = [3, 3, 3, 4, \\times], count = [0, 0, 3, 1, 0]$$$. The maximum value is $$$3$$$ and is reached only at the $$$3$$$ position, so the generator will choose this position.\nAt the $$$5$$$ step, $$$r = [4, 4, 4, 4, \\times], count = [0, 0, 0, 4, 0]$$$. The maximum value is $$$4$$$ and is reached only at the $$$4$$$ position, so the generator will choose this position.\nIn total, we got a permutation of $$$2, 3, 4, 5, 1$$$, that is, a generator could generate it.\n\n\n\nPlease use a python program to solve this problem\n\nexample_input:\n5\n5\n2 3 4 5 1\n1\n1\n3\n1 3 2\n4\n4 2 3 1\n5\n1 5 2 4 3\n\n\nexample_output:\nYes\nYes\nNo\nYes\nNo\n\n\nTime limit:\n1 second\n\nMemory limit:\n256 megabytes\n\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

To go from the $$$x$$$-th room to the $$$y$$$-th room, there must exist a tunnel between $$$x$$$ and $$$y$$$, and it takes $$$\\max(|a_x + a_y|, |a_x - a_y|)$$$ energy. $$$|z|$$$ denotes the absolute value of $$$z$$$.\nTo prevent grave robbers, the maze can change the illusion rate of any room in it. Chanek and Indiana would ask $$$q$$$ queries.\nThere are two types of queries to be done:\n -  $$$1\\ u\\ c$$$ \u2014 The illusion rate of the $$$x$$$-th room is changed to $$$c$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u \\leq n$$$, $$$0 \\leq |c| \\leq 10^9$$$). -  $$$2\\ u\\ v$$$ \u2014 Chanek and Indiana ask you the minimum sum of energy needed to take the secret treasure at room $$$v$$$ if they are initially at room $$$u$$$ ($$$1 \\leq u, v \\leq n$$$). Help them, so you can get a portion of the treasure!\n\nInput\nThe first line contains two integers $$$n$$$ and $$$q$$$ ($$$2 \\leq n \\leq 10^5$$$, $$$1 \\leq q \\leq 10^5$$$) \u2014 the number of rooms in the maze and the number of queries.\nThe second line contains $$$n$$$ integers $$$a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n$$$ ($$$0 \\leq |a_i| \\leq 10^9$$$) \u2014 inital illusion rate of each room.\nThe $$$i$$$-th of the next $$$n-1$$$ lines contains two integers $$$s_i$$$ and $$$t_i$$$ ($$$1 \\leq s_i, t_i \\leq n$$$), meaning there is a tunnel connecting $$$s_i$$$-th room and $$$t_i$$$-th room. The given edges form a tree.\nThe next $$$q$$$ lines contain the query as described. The given queries are valid.\n\nOutput\nFor each type $$$2$$$ query, output a line containing an integer \u2014 the minimum sum of energy needed for Chanek and Indiana to take the secret treasure.\n\nExample\nInput\n6 4\n10 -9 2 -1 4 -6\n1 5\n5 4\n5 6\n6 2\n6 3\n2 1 2\n1 1 -3\n2 1 2\n2 3 3\n\n\nOutput\n39\n32\n0\n\n\n\n\nNote\n ![image](1.png) In the first query, their movement from the $$$1$$$-st to the $$$2$$$-nd room is as follows.\n -  $$$1 \\rightarrow 5$$$ \u2014 takes $$$\\max(|10 + 4|, |10 - 4|) = 14$$$ energy. -  $$$5 \\rightarrow 6$$$ \u2014 takes $$$\\max(|4 + (-6)|, |4 - (-6)|) = 10$$$ energy. -  $$$6 \\rightarrow 2$$$ \u2014 takes $$$\\max(|-6 + (-9)|, |-6 - (-9)|) = 15$$$ energy.  In total, it takes $$$39$$$ energy.In the second query, the illusion rate of the $$$1$$$-st room changes from $$$10$$$ to $$$-3$$$.\nIn the third query, their movement from the $$$1$$$-st to the $$$2$$$-nd room is as follows.\n -  $$$1 \\rightarrow 5$$$ \u2014 takes $$$\\max(|-3 + 4|, |-3 - 4|) = 7$$$ energy. -  $$$5 \\rightarrow 6$$$ \u2014 takes $$$\\max(|4 + (-6)|, |4 - (-6)|) = 10$$$ energy. -  $$$6 \\rightarrow 2$$$ \u2014 takes $$$\\max(|-6 + (-9)|, |-6 - (-9)|) = 15$$$ energy.

At the beginning of the game, there is no wall on the board.\n\nIn this game, two players alternately move as follows:\n\n-  A player chooses one of the empty cells (not marked and not wall). If the player can't choose a cell, he loses.\n-  Towards each of the four directions (upper, lower, left, and right) from the chosen cell, the player changes cells (including the chosen cell) to walls until the player first reaches a wall or the outside of the board.\n\nNote that marked cells cannot be chosen in step 1, but they can be changed to walls in step 2.\n\nFig.1 shows an example of a move in which a player chooses the cell at the third row and the fourth\ncolumn.\n\n![image](1.png)\nFig.1: An example of a move in Wall Making Game.\n\nYour task is to write a program that determines which player wins the game if the two players play optimally from a given initial board.\n\nInput\n\nThe first line of the input consists of two integers $H$ and $W$ $(1 \\leq H, W \\leq 20)$, where $H$ and $W$ are the height and the width of the board respectively.

The only difference is that when a billiard ball hits the board's border, it can reflect from it and continue moving.\nMore formally, first one of four diagonal directions is chosen and the billiard ball moves in that direction. When it reaches the square located on the board's edge, the billiard ball reflects from it; it changes the direction of its movement by 90 degrees and continues moving. Specifically, having reached a corner square, the billiard ball is reflected twice and starts to move the opposite way. While it moves, the billiard ball can make an infinite number of reflections. At any square of its trajectory the billiard ball can stop and on that the move is considered completed.\n ![image](1.png) It is considered that one billiard ball a beats another billiard ball b if a can reach a point where b is located.\nYou are suggested to find the maximal number of billiard balls, that pairwise do not beat each other and that can be positioned on a chessboard n\u2009\u00d7\u2009m in size.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains two integers n and m (2\u2009\u2264\u2009n,\u2009m\u2009\u2264\u200910^{6}).\n\nOutput\nPrint a single number, the maximum possible number of billiard balls that do not pairwise beat each other.\nPlease do not use the %lld specificator to read or write 64-bit numbers in C++.

Each part consists of n vertices; i-th vertex of part A is denoted as A_{i}, and i-th vertex of part B is denoted as B_{i}.\nFor each index i (1\u2009\u2264\u2009i\u2009<\u2009n) there is a directed edge from vertex A_{i} to vertex A_{i\u2009+\u20091}, and from B_{i} to B_{i\u2009+\u20091}, respectively. Capacities of these edges are given in the input. Also there might be several directed edges going from part A to part B (but never from B to A).\nYou have to calculate the maximum flow value from A_{1} to B_{n} in this network. Capacities of edges connecting A_{i} to A_{i\u2009+\u20091} might sometimes change, and you also have to maintain the maximum flow value after these changes. Apart from that, the network is fixed (there are no changes in part B, no changes of edges going from A to B, and no edge insertions or deletions).\nTake a look at the example and the notes to understand the structure of the network better.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains three integer numbers n, m and q (2\u2009\u2264\u2009n,\u2009m\u2009\u2264\u20092\u00b710^{5}, 0\u2009\u2264\u2009q\u2009\u2264\u20092\u00b710^{5}) \u2014 the number of vertices in each part, the number of edges going from A to B and the number of changes, respectively.\nThen n\u2009-\u20091 lines follow, i-th line contains two integers x_{i} and y_{i} denoting that the edge from A_{i} to A_{i\u2009+\u20091} has capacity x_{i} and the edge from B_{i} to B_{i\u2009+\u20091} has capacity y_{i} (1\u2009\u2264\u2009x_{i},\u2009y_{i}\u2009\u2264\u200910^{9}).\nThen m lines follow, describing the edges from A to B. Each line contains three integers x, y and z denoting an edge from A_{x} to B_{y} with capacity z (1\u2009\u2264\u2009x,\u2009y\u2009\u2264\u2009n, 1\u2009\u2264\u2009z\u2009\u2264\u200910^{9}). There might be multiple edges from A_{x} to B_{y}.\nAnd then q lines follow, describing a sequence of changes to the network. i-th line contains two integers v_{i} and w_{i}, denoting that the capacity of the edge from A_{vi} to A_{vi\u2009+\u20091} is set to w_{i} (1\u2009\u2264\u2009v_{i}\u2009<\u2009n, 1\u2009\u2264\u2009w_{i}\u2009\u2264\u200910^{9}).\n\nOutput\nFirstly, print the maximum flow value in the original network.

            "question": "Reordering the Documents\n\n  Susan is good at arranging her dining table for convenience, but not her office desk.\n\n  Susan has just finished the paperwork on a set of documents, which are still piled on her desk. They have serial numbers and were stacked in order when her boss brought them in. The ordering, however, is not perfect now, as she has been too lazy to put the documents slid out of the pile back to their proper positions. Hearing that she has finished, the boss wants her to return the documents immediately in the document box he is sending her. The documents should be stowed in the box, of course, in the order of their serial numbers.\n\n  The desk has room just enough for two more document piles where Susan plans to make two temporary piles. All the documents in the current pile are to be moved one by one from the top to either of the two temporary piles. As making these piles too tall in haste would make them tumble, not too many documents should be placed on them. After moving all the documents to the temporary piles and receiving the document box, documents in the two piles will be moved from their tops, one by one, into the box. Documents should be in reverse order of their serial numbers in the two piles to allow moving them to the box in order.\n\n  For example, assume that the pile has six documents #1, #3, #4, #2, #6, and #5, in this order from the top, and that the temporary piles can have no more than three documents. Then, she can form two temporary piles, one with documents #6, #4, and #3, from the top, and the other with #5, #2, and #1 (Figure E.1). Both of the temporary piles are reversely ordered. Then, comparing the serial numbers of documents on top of the two temporary piles, one with the larger number (#6, in this case) is to be removed and stowed into the document box first. Repeating this, all the documents will be perfectly ordered in the document box.\n\n![image](1.png)\n  Figure E.1. Making two temporary piles\n\n  Susan is wondering whether the plan is actually feasible with the documents in the current pile and, if so, how many different ways of stacking them to two temporary piles would do. You are asked to help Susan by writing a program to compute the number of different ways, which should be zero if the plan is not feasible.\n\n  As each of the documents in the pile can be moved to either of the two temporary piles, for $n$ documents, there are $2^n$ different choice combinations in total, but some of them may disturb the reverse order of the temporary piles and are thus inappropriate.\n\n  The example described above corresponds to the first case of the sample input. In this case, the last two documents, #5 and #6, can be swapped their destinations. Also, exchanging the roles of two temporary piles totally will be OK. As any other move sequences would make one of the piles higher than three and/or make them out of order, the total number of different ways of stacking documents to temporary piles in this example is $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n\nInput\n\n  The input consists of a single test case of the following format.\n\n$n$ $m$\n$s_1$ ...  $s_n$\n\n  \n  Here, $n$ is the number of documents in the pile ($1 \\leq n \\leq 5000$), and $m$ is the number of documents that can be stacked in one temporary pile without committing risks of making it tumble down ($n/2 \\leq m \\leq n$). Numbers $s_1$ through $s_n$ are the serial numbers of the documents in the document pile, from its top to its bottom. It is guaranteed that all the numbers $1$ through $n$ appear exactly once.\n\nOutput\n\n  Output a single integer in a line which is the number of ways to form two temporary piles suited for the objective. When no choice will do, the number of ways is $0$, of course.\n\n  If the number of possible ways is greater than or equal to $10^9 + 7$, output the number of ways modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\nSample Input 1 \n\n6 3\n1 3 4 2 6 5\n\nSample Output 1\n\n4\n\nSample Input 2 \n\n6 6\n1 3 4 2 6 5\n\nSample Output 2\n\n8\n\nSample Input 3 \n\n4 4\n4 3 1 2\n\nSample Output 3\n\n0\n\n\nPlease use a python program to solve this problem\n\nexample_input:\n6 3\n1 3 4 2 6 5\n\n\nexample_output:\n4\n\n\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

            "question": "Ivan places knights on infinite chessboard. Initially there are $$$n$$$ knights. If there is free cell which is under attack of at least $$$4$$$ knights then he places new knight in this cell. Ivan repeats this until there are no such free cells. One can prove that this process is finite. One can also prove that position in the end does not depend on the order in which new knights are placed.\nIvan asked you to find initial placement of exactly $$$n$$$ knights such that in the end there will be at least $$$\\lfloor \\frac{n^{2}}{10} \\rfloor$$$ knights.\n\nInput\nThe only line of input contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\le n \\le 10^{3}$$$)\u00a0\u2014 number of knights in the initial placement.\n\nOutput\nPrint $$$n$$$ lines. Each line should contain $$$2$$$ numbers $$$x_{i}$$$ and $$$y_{i}$$$ ($$$-10^{9} \\le x_{i}, \\,\\, y_{i} \\le 10^{9}$$$)\u00a0\u2014 coordinates of $$$i$$$-th knight. For all $$$i \\ne j$$$, $$$(x_{i}, \\,\\, y_{i}) \\ne (x_{j}, \\,\\, y_{j})$$$ should hold. In other words, all knights should be in different cells.\nIt is guaranteed that the solution exists.\n\nExamples\nInput\n4\n\n\nOutput\n1 1\n3 1\n1 5\n4 4\n\n\nInput\n7\n\n\nOutput\n2 1\n1 2\n4 1\n5 2\n2 6\n5 7\n6 6\n\n\n\n\nNote\nLet's look at second example:\n![image](1.png)\nGreen zeroes are initial knights. Cell $$$(3, \\,\\, 3)$$$ is under attack of $$$4$$$ knights in cells $$$(1, \\,\\, 2)$$$, $$$(2, \\,\\, 1)$$$, $$$(4, \\,\\, 1)$$$ and $$$(5, \\,\\, 2)$$$, therefore Ivan will place a knight in this cell. Cell $$$(4, \\,\\, 5)$$$ is initially attacked by only $$$3$$$ knights in cells $$$(2, \\,\\, 6)$$$, $$$(5, \\,\\, 7)$$$ and $$$(6, \\,\\, 6)$$$. But new knight in cell $$$(3, \\,\\, 3)$$$ also attacks cell $$$(4, \\,\\, 5)$$$, now it is attacked by $$$4$$$ knights and Ivan will place another knight in this cell. There are no more free cells which are attacked by $$$4$$$ or more knights, so the process stops. There are $$$9$$$ knights in the end, which is not less than $$$\\lfloor \\frac{7^{2}}{10} \\rfloor = 4$$$.\n\n\n\nPlease use a python program to solve this problem\n\nexample_input:\n4\n\n\nexample_output:\n0 0\n1 0\n1 3\n2 0\n\n\nTime limit:\n1 second\n\nMemory limit:\n256 megabytes\n\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

He can perform the following two operations:\n -  Draw triangle: Tenzing will choose two non-negative integers $$$a$$$, $$$b$$$ that satisfy $$$a+b<k$$$, then all points inside the triangle formed by lines $$$x=a$$$, $$$y=b$$$ and $$$x+y=k$$$ will be erased. It can be shown that this triangle is an isosceles right triangle. Let the side lengths of the triangle be $$$l$$$, $$$l$$$ and $$$\\sqrt 2 l$$$ respectively. Then, the cost of this operation is $$$l \\cdot A$$$.The blue area of the following picture describes the triangle with $$$a=1,b=1$$$ with cost $$$=1\\cdot A$$$. ![image](1.png) -  Erase a specific point: Tenzing will choose an integer $$$i$$$ that satisfies $$$1 \\leq i \\leq n$$$ and erase the point $$$i$$$. The cost of this operation is $$$c_i$$$.Help Tenzing find the minimum cost to erase all of the points.\n\nInput\nThe first line of the input contains three integers $$$n$$$, $$$k$$$ and $$$A$$$ ($$$1\\leq n,k\\leq 2\\cdot 10^5$$$, $$$1\\leq A\\leq 10^4$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of points, the coefficient describing the hypotenuse of the triangle and the coefficient describing the cost of drawing a triangle.\nThe following $$$n$$$ lines of the input the $$$i$$$-th line contains three integers $$$x_i,y_i,c_i$$$ ($$$0\\leq x_i,y_i,x_i+y_i< k$$$, $$$1\\leq c_i\\leq 10^4$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the coordinate of the $$$i$$$-th points and the cost of erasing it using the second operation.

Then he performs the following q actions with the remaining triangular part: first, he chooses a piece on the anti-diagonal and either direction 'up' or 'left', and then he begins to eat all the pieces starting from the selected cell, moving in the selected direction until he reaches the already eaten piece or chocolate bar edge.\nAfter each action, he wants to know how many pieces he ate as a result of this action.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains integers n (1\u2009\u2264\u2009n\u2009\u2264\u200910^{9}) and q (1\u2009\u2264\u2009q\u2009\u2264\u20092\u00b710^{5}) \u2014 the size of the chocolate bar and the number of actions.\nNext q lines contain the descriptions of the actions: the i-th of them contains numbers x_{i} and y_{i} (1\u2009\u2264\u2009x_{i},\u2009y_{i}\u2009\u2264\u2009n, x_{i}\u2009+\u2009y_{i}\u2009=\u2009n\u2009+\u20091) \u2014 the numbers of the column and row of the chosen cell and the character that represents the direction (L \u2014 left, U \u2014 up).\n\nOutput\nPrint q lines, the i-th of them should contain the number of eaten pieces as a result of the i-th action.\n\nExamples\nInput\n6 5\n3 4 U\n6 1 L\n2 5 L\n1 6 U\n4 3 U\n\n\nOutput\n4\n3\n2\n1\n2\n\n\nInput\n10 6\n2 9 U\n10 1 U\n1 10 U\n8 3 L\n10 1 L\n6 5 U\n\n\nOutput\n9\n1\n10\n6\n0\n2\n\n\n\n\nNote\nPictures to the sample tests:\n![image](1.png)\nThe pieces that were eaten in the same action are painted the same color.

            "question": "# Problem Description\nThis problem involves a grid-based transformation where we need to simulate the absorption of orange dots by purple lines emanating from a red triangle. The goal is to calculate the minimum number of iterations required to convert all orange dots into purple dots, following specific geometric rules of absorption.\n\n# Visual Facts\n1. **Grid Structure:**\n   - The grid is a 4x4 coordinate system (0-3 on both axes).\n   - Grid points are discrete integer coordinates.\n   - The origin (0,0) is at the top-left corner.\n\n2. **Components:**\n   - One red triangle (fixed position).\n   - Multiple orange dots (initial state).\n   - Purple dots (transformed state).\n   - Purple lines (transformation medium).\n\n3. **Transformation Sequence:**\n   - Initial state shows orange dots and one red triangle.\n   - Iter1: Vertical line absorption.\n   - Iter2: Diagonal line absorption.\n   - Iter3: Horizontal line absorption.\n   - Iter4: Final vertical absorption.\n   - Process completes in exactly 4 iterations in the example.\n\n# Visual Patterns\n1. **Line Properties:**\n   - Each purple line must pass through the red triangle.\n   - Lines can be:\n     * Vertical (constant x).\n     * Horizontal (constant y).\n     * Diagonal (linear with slope).\n   - The line has only one direction, emitting from the red triangle.\n\n2. **Absorption Rules:**\n   - Any orange dot lying exactly on a purple line gets absorbed.\n   - Multiple dots can be absorbed in a single iteration if they lie on the same line.\n   - Each dot can only be absorbed once.\n   - The line must pass through both the triangle and at least one orange dot.\n   - The line is emitted unidirectionally from the red triangle. For example, if two purple points and the red triangle are on the same horizontal line, but one is to the left of the triangle and the other to the right, the triangle needs to emit two lines to absorb them.\n   - Example\uff1a\n      red_triangle=(3, 1), orange_dots=[(3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3)]\n      The orange dots and the red triangle share the same x-coordinate (3), but have different y-coordinates. It can be observed that (3, 0) and the other two orange dots are not on the same side.\n      To convert the three orange dots, the red triangle needs to emit a purple line to (3, 0) first, and then emit another purple line to (3, 2) and (3, 3). Therefore, it takes a total of two iterations to convert them.\n\n\n3. **Optimization Patterns:**\n   - Lines are chosen to maximize the number of dots absorbed per iteration.\n   - Dots that share geometric alignment (same x, y, or slope relative to triangle) should be absorbed together.\n   - The order of absorption can affect the total number of iterations.\n   - Priority seems to be given to lines that can absorb multiple dots simultaneously.\n\n4. **Mathematical Constraints:**\n   - For dots to be absorbed in the same iteration, they must satisfy one of:\n     * Same x-coordinate as triangle (vertical line).\n     * Same y-coordinate as triangle (horizontal line).\n     * Share the same slope relative to triangle position (diagonal line).\n     * Points must be collinear with the triangle.\n\n5. **Iteration Strategy:**\n   - Given the red triangle's position (x0, y0):\n     - Traverse all the orange dots and classify each dot into a group according to the following rule.\n     - Find the dots with xi=x0 and y>y0, these points belong to the same group.\n     - Find the dots with xi=x0 and y<y0, these points belong to the same group.\n     - Find the dots with yi=y0 and x>x0, these points belong to the same group.\n     - Find the dots with yi=y0 and x<x0, these points belong to the same group.\n     - Then compute all the slopes to the orange dots (yi-y0)/(xi-x0).\n     - Slopes that are equal and have y > y0 belong to the same group, while slopes that are equal and have y<y0 belong to another group.\n     - The total iteration is the number of groups.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

Alternatively, the rows of the input matrix become the columns of the output matrix, but in reverse order.\n\nFor example, in the first case:\n- Input[0][0] = A becomes Output[0][3] = D\n- Input[0][1] = B becomes Output[0][2] = C\n- Input[0][2] = C becomes Output[0][1] = B\n- Input[0][3] = D becomes Output[0][0] = A\n\nThis is consistent with the observed transformation.\n\nThe second example confirms this pattern.\n\nTherefore, the transformation is a 180-degree rotation.\n\n\\boxed{180-degree rotation}",

The coordinate system is a 10x10 grid (from 0 to 10 on both axes)\n2. The grid has clear boundaries at x=0, x=10, y=0, and y=10\n3. Start point (green circle) is located around (8, 7)\n4.

            "output": "The problem describes a ball trajectory within a 10x10 grid, bouncing off the boundaries according to the law of reflection. The goal is to determine if a ball starting from a given position with a given direction can reach a target position. The visual facts and patterns highlight the geometric nature of the problem.\n\nThe key insight is to \"unfold\" the trajectory by reflecting the grid.  Each bounce can be thought of as continuing the path in a reflected grid.  If the target point appears in one of these reflected grids when starting from the initial point and direction, then a path exists.\n\nLet the start point be (x0, y0) and the target point be (xt, yt). Let the initial direction be (dx, dy).  We can consider the general equation of the line representing the ball's path:\n\ny = y0 + (x - x0) * (dy / dx)\n\nHowever, since the ball bounces, we need to account for the reflections.  We can represent the bounces by changing the signs of dx and dy.  The problem is equivalent to finding integers m and n such that:\n\nxt = x0 + m * 10 * dx  or  xt = x0 + m * 10 * (-dx)\nyt = y0 + n * 10 * dy  or  yt = y0 + n * 10 * (-dy)\n\nwhere m and n are integers representing the number of reflections in the x and y directions, respectively.\n\nFrom the image, the start point is approximately (8, 7) and the target point is approximately (6, 9). The direction is roughly (-1, 1).  Let's assume the start point is (8, 7), the target is (6, 9), and the direction is (-1, 1).\n\nThen we have:\n6 = 8 + m * 10 * (-1)  =>  -2 = -10m  => m = 0.2 (not an integer)\n6 = 8 + m * 10 * (1) => -2 = 10m => m = -0.2 (not an integer)\n\n9 = 7 + n * 10 * (1) => 2 = 10n => n = 0.2 (not an integer)\n9 = 7 + n * 10 * (-1) => 2 = -10n => n = -0.2 (not an integer)\n\nSince m and n are not integers, this initial guess is incorrect.\n\nLet's analyze the image more carefully. The direction appears to be approximately (-2, 1). Let's try that.\n6 = 8 + m * 10 * (-2) => -2 = -20m => m = 0.1 (not an integer)\n6 = 8 + m * 10 * (2) => -2 = 20m => m = -0.1 (not an integer)\n\n9 = 7 + n * 10 * (1) => 2 = 10n => n = 0.2 (not an integer)\n9 = 7 + n * 10 * (-1) => 2 = -10n => n = -0.2 (not an integer)\n\nThe image shows a clear path.

We use squared distance to avoid the computationally expensive `np.sqrt()` operation.\n     - Checks if the squared distance is greater than the squared radius (`radius**2`). If it is, the point is outside the circle and is considered valid.\n     - If the point is valid, it's appended to the `points` list.\n   - After the loop finishes, the `points` list (which now contains `num_points` valid points) is converted to a NumPy array using `np.array(points)` and returned.\n\n2. **Main part of the code:**\n   - Calls the `generate_points()` function with the default parameters (1000 points, radius 0.25, center (0.5, 0.5)).\n   - Stores the returned NumPy array in the variable `points`.\n   - Assigns the `points` array to the variable `answer`.\n\n**How it addresses the problem description and visual facts:**\n\n- **Square Boundary:** The `np.random.uniform(0, 1)` function ensures that all generated points have x and y coordinates between 0 and 1, satisfying the square boundary condition.\n- **Circular Sparse Region:** The distance calculation and the `if distance > radius**2` condition ensure that points within the circle are rejected, creating the sparse region.\n- **Uniform Distribution Outside Circle:**  Generating points uniformly within the square and rejecting those inside the circle results in a uniform distribution of points outside the circle.\n- **Number of Points:** The `while` loop continues until exactly 1000 valid points are generated.\n- **Visual Correspondence:** The generated points closely resemble the distribution shown in the provided image, with a clear avoidance of the central circular region and a relatively uniform distribution elsewhere.\n\n",

            "output": "The problem asks us to find the number of inverted green triangles at iteration level *t*.  From the visual patterns, we observe that the number of green triangles at iteration *t* is the sum of the first 2^(t-1) - 1 natural numbers.  The sum of the first *n* natural numbers is given by the formula n(n+1)/2.  Therefore, the number of green triangles at iteration *t* is (2^(t-1) - 1)(2^(t-1) - 1 + 1) / 2 = (2^(t-1) - 1) * 2^(t-1) / 2 = (2^(t-1) - 1) * 2^(t-2).\n\nLet's verify this formula with the given examples:\n- T=1: (2^(1-1) - 1) * 2^(1-2) = (1-1) * 2^(-1) = 0 * 0.5 = 0\n- T=2: (2^(2-1) - 1) * 2^(2-2) = (2-1) * 2^0 = 1 * 1 = 1\n- T=3: (2^(3-1) - 1) * 2^(3-2) = (4-1) * 2^1 = 3 * 2 = 6\n- T=4: (2^(4-1) - 1) * 2^(4-2) = (8-1) * 2^2 = 7 * 4 = 28\n\nThe formula seems to be correct.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{(2^{t-1}-1)2^{t-2}}$",

Each time a particle crosses a boundary, it loses energy equal to half of that boundary's energy value. A particle can only continue if its remaining energy is greater than 0. The goal is to count how many particles successfully pass through all boundaries.\n\n# Visual Facts\n1. Example 1 shows:\n   - Initial particles PE\u2081: [49, 35, 21]\n   - Two boundaries: BE\u2081=60, BE\u2082=10\n   - Final remaining particles energy: 14 (1 particle)\n\n2. Example 2 shows:\n   - Initial particles PE\u2081: [59, 65, 21, 87, 92]\n   - Three boundaries: BE\u2081=20, BE\u2082=80, BE\u2083=60\n   - Final remaining particles energy: [7, 12] (2 particles)\n\n3. At each boundary, the formula PE_next = PE_current - BE/2 is applied\n\n4. The arrows indicate particle progression through boundaries\n\n# Visual Patterns\n1. Energy Reduction Pattern:\n   - At each boundary, particle energy is reduced by BE/2\n   - Example 1: First boundary reduces by 60/2 = 30\n   - Example 2: First boundary reduces by 20/2 = 10\n\n2. Elimination Pattern:\n   - Particles are eliminated if their energy becomes \u2264 0\n   - In Example 1, only particles with sufficient energy progress\n   - In Example 2, some particles are eliminated at BE\u2082 (80/2 = 40 reduction)\n\n3. Success Criteria:\n   - A particle must maintain positive energy after all boundary crossings\n   - The final energy must be > 0 to be counted\n   - The count of remaining particles > 0 is the return value\n\n4. Mathematical Rules:\n   - For a particle P to pass boundary B: P - B/2 > 0\n   - This must be true for all boundaries in sequence\n   - The energy reduction is cumulative across boundaries\n   - Formula for final energy: PE_final = PE_initial - \u03a3(BE_i/2) for all boundaries i\n\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",
            "output": "Okay, let's analyze the problem and devise a solution. The core task is to determine how many particles, starting with initial energies, successfully traverse a series of energy boundaries, losing half the boundary's energy at each step. A particle is eliminated if its energy drops to zero or below.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the approach:\n\n1. **Iterate through particles:** For each particle's initial energy.\n2. **Iterate through boundaries:** For each boundary, calculate the particle's energy after crossing it.\n3. **Check for elimination:** If the particle's energy becomes less than or equal to zero at any boundary, the particle is eliminated.\n4. **Count successful particles:** If a particle survives all boundaries, increment the count of successful particles.\n\nLet's apply this to the provided examples to confirm our understanding:\n\n*   **Example 1:**\n    *   Initial energies: \\[49, 35, 21]\n    *   Boundaries: 60, 10\n    *   Particle 1 (49):\n        *   After boundary 1: 49 - 60/2 = 49 - 30 = 19\n        *   After boundary 2: 19 - 10/2 = 19 - 5 = 14\n    *   Particle 2 (35):\n        *   After boundary 1: 35 - 30 = 5\n        *   After boundary 2: 5 - 5 = 0. Eliminated.\n    *   Particle 3 (21):\n        *   After boundary 1: 21 - 30 = -9. Eliminated.\n    *   Successful particles: 1 (with final energy 14)\n\n*   **Example 2:**\n    *   Initial energies: \\[59, 65, 21, 87, 92]\n    *   Boundaries: 20, 80, 60\n    *   Particle 1 (59):\n        *   After boundary 1: 59 - 20/2 = 59 - 10 = 49\n        *   After boundary 2: 49 - 80/2 = 49 - 40 = 9\n        *   After boundary 3: 9 - 60/2 = 9 - 30 = -21. Eliminated.\n    *   Particle 2 (65):\n        *   After boundary 1: 65 - 10 = 55\n        *   After boundary 2: 55 - 40 = 15\n        *   After boundary 3: 15 - 30 = -15. Eliminated.\n    *   Particle 3 (21):\n        *   After boundary 1: 21 - 10 = 11\n        *   After boundary 2: 11 - 40 = -29. Eliminated.\n    *   Particle 4 (87):\n        *   After boundary 1: 87 - 10 = 77\n        *   After boundary 2: 77 - 40 = 37\n        *   After boundary 3: 37 - 30 = 7\n    *   Particle 5 (92):\n        *   After boundary 1: 92 - 10 = 82\n        *   After boundary 2: 82 - 40 = 42\n        *   After boundary 3: 42 - 30 = 12\n    *   Successful particles: 2 (with final energies 7 and 12)\n\nThe logic is sound and matches the examples.\n\nNow, let's consider a general case.  The problem doesn't provide a specific input to process, so we can't calculate a numerical answer. However, the question asks for the final answer to be stored in \\boxed{answer}. Since the problem is about *counting* successful particles, and we've established the method to do so, the answer is the number of particles that survive all boundaries.\n\n\\boxed{answer}",
