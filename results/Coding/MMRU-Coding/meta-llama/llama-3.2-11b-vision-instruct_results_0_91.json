On each edge of the tree, there's a set of Christmas lights, which can be represented by an integer in binary representation.\n ![image](1.png) He has $$$m$$$ elves come over and admire his tree. Each elf is assigned two nodes, $$$a$$$ and $$$b$$$, and that elf looks at all lights on the simple path between the two nodes. After this, the elf's favorite number becomes the bitwise XOR of the values of the lights on the edges in that path.\nHowever, the North Pole has been recovering from a nasty bout of flu. Because of this, Santa forgot some of the configurations of lights he had put on the tree, and he has already left the North Pole! Fortunately, the elves came to the rescue, and each one told Santa what pair of nodes he was assigned $$$(a_i, b_i)$$$, as well as the parity of the number of set bits in his favorite number. In other words, he remembers whether the number of $$$1$$$'s when his favorite number is written in binary is odd or even.\nHelp Santa determine if it's possible that the memories are consistent, and if it is, remember what his tree looked like, and maybe you'll go down in history!\n\nInput\nThe first line contains one integer $$$t$$$ ($$$1 \\leq t \\leq 2 \\cdot 10^4$$$)\u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases.

If \n -  $$$v = -1$$$: Santa doesn't remember what the set of lights were on for this edge. -  $$$v \\geq 0$$$: The set of lights on the edge is $$$v$$$.

We represent the cell at the intersection of row $$$r$$$ and column $$$c$$$ with ordered pair $$$(r, c)$$$. Each cell in the grid is either land or water.\n ![image](1.png) An example planet with $$$n = 5$$$. It also appears in the first sample test. Alice resides in land cell $$$(r_1, c_1)$$$. She wishes to travel to land cell $$$(r_2, c_2)$$$. At any moment, she may move to one of the cells adjacent to where she is\u2014in one of the four directions (i.e., up, down, left, or right).\nUnfortunately, Alice cannot swim, and there is no viable transportation means other than by foot (i.e., she can walk only on land). As a result, Alice's trip may be impossible.\nTo help Alice, you plan to create at most one tunnel between some two land cells. The tunnel will allow Alice to freely travel between the two endpoints. Indeed, creating a tunnel is a lot of effort: the cost of creating a tunnel between cells $$$(r_s, c_s)$$$ and $$$(r_t, c_t)$$$ is $$$(r_s-r_t)^2 + (c_s-c_t)^2$$$.\nFor now, your task is to find the minimum possible cost of creating at most one tunnel so that Alice could travel from $$$(r_1, c_1)$$$ to $$$(r_2, c_2)$$$. If no tunnel needs to be created, the cost is $$$0$$$.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains one integer $$$n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq n \\leq 50$$$) \u2014 the width of the square grid.\nThe second line contains two space-separated integers $$$r_1$$$ and $$$c_1$$$ ($$$1 \\leq r_1, c_1 \\leq n$$$) \u2014 denoting the cell where Alice resides.\nThe third line contains two space-separated integers $$$r_2$$$ and $$$c_2$$$ ($$$1 \\leq r_2, c_2 \\leq n$$$) \u2014 denoting the cell to which Alice wishes to travel.\nEach of the following $$$n$$$ lines contains a string of $$$n$$$ characters.

The cost of doing so is $$$(1-4)^2 + (4-5)^2 = 10$$$, which is optimal. This way, Alice could walk from $$$(1, 1)$$$ to $$$(1, 4)$$$, use the tunnel from $$$(1, 4)$$$ to $$$(4, 5)$$$, and lastly walk from $$$(4, 5)$$$ to $$$(5, 5)$$$.\nIn the second sample, clearly a tunnel between cells $$$(1, 3)$$$ and $$$(3, 1)$$$ needs to be created.

            "output": "(\"Here is the solution to the problem:\\n\\n**Problem Statement**\\n\\nArkady wants to bake a Napoleon cake, which requires baking $n$ dry layers and then stacking them with cream. He starts with an empty plate and performs the following steps $n$ times:\\n\\n*   Place a new cake layer on top of the stack.\\n*   After the $i$-th layer is placed, pour $a_i$ units of cream on top of the stack.\\n\\nThe problem asks us to determine which layers of the cake eventually get drenched when the process is over and which don't.\\n\\n**Solution**\\n\\nTo solve this problem, we can use a stack data structure to keep track of the layers that get drenched.

If the graph contains a negative cycle, the function should return an array consisting of only -1.\\n\\n**Step 2: Identify the key components**\\n\\n*   The graph is represented as an adjacency list, where each index represents a vertex, and the value at that index is a list of tuples containing the adjacent vertex and the weight of the edge.\\n*   The source vertex is given as input.\\n*   The function should return a list of integers, where the ith integer represents the shortest distance from the source to the ith vertex.\\n\\n**Step 3: Determine the approach**\\n\\nTo solve this problem, we can use Bellman-Ford's algorithm, which is suitable for finding the shortest path in a graph with negative weight edges. The algorithm works by iteratively relaxing the edges of the graph, updating the distance of each vertex if a shorter path is found.\\n\\n**Step 4: Implement the solution**\\n\\nHere is the Python code for the Bellman-Ford algorithm:\\n\\n```python\\ndef bellman_ford(V, E, S):\\n    # Initialize distance array with infinity for all vertices except the source\\n    distance = [float('inf')] * V\\n    distance[S] = 0\\n\\n    # Relax edges repeatedly\\n    for _ in range(V - 1):\\n        for u, v, w in E:\\n            if distance[u] != float('inf') and distance[u] + w < distance[v]:\\n                distance[v] = distance[u] + w\\n\\n    # Check for negative-weight cycles\\n    for u, v, w in E:\\n        if distance[u] != float('inf') and distance[u] + w < distance[v]:\\n            return [-1]\\n\\n    return distance\\n\\n# Example usage\\nV = 3\\nE = [[0, 1, 9], [1, 2, -1], [2, 0, 1]]\\nS = 0\\nprint(bellman_ford(V, E, S))  # Output: [0, 1, 0]\\n```\\n\\n**Step 5: Test the solution**\\n\\nThe provided code implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm to find the shortest distance of all vertices from a source vertex in a weighted, directed, and connected graph.

When he entered the first courtyard, he met a strange man who was selling something. \nDenis bought a mysterious item and it was... Random permutation generator! Denis could not believed his luck.\nWhen he arrived home, he began to study how his generator works and learned the algorithm. The process of generating a permutation consists of $$$n$$$ steps. At the $$$i$$$-th step, a place is chosen for the number $$$i$$$ $$$(1 \\leq i \\leq n)$$$. The position for the number $$$i$$$ is defined as follows:\n -  For all $$$j$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, we calculate $$$r_j$$$ \u00a0\u2014 the minimum index such that $$$j \\leq r_j \\leq n$$$, and the position $$$r_j$$$ is not yet occupied in the permutation. If there are no such positions, then we assume that the value of $$$r_j$$$ is not defined. -  For all $$$t$$$ from $$$1$$$ to $$$n$$$, we calculate $$$count_t$$$ \u00a0\u2014 the number of positions $$$1 \\leq j \\leq n$$$ such that $$$r_j$$$ is defined and $$$r_j = t$$$. -  Consider the positions that are still not occupied by permutation and among those we consider the positions for which the value in the $$$count$$$ array is maximum. -  The generator selects one of these positions for the number $$$i$$$. The generator can choose any position. Let's have a look at the operation of the algorithm in the following example:\n ![image](1.png) Let $$$n = 5$$$ and the algorithm has already arranged the numbers $$$1, 2, 3$$$ in the permutation. Consider how the generator will choose a position for the number $$$4$$$:\n -  The values of $$$r$$$ will be $$$r = [3, 3, 3, 4, \\times]$$$, where $$$\\times$$$ means an indefinite value. -  Then the $$$count$$$ values will be $$$count = [0, 0, 3, 1, 0]$$$. -  There are only two unoccupied positions in the permutation: $$$3$$$ and $$$4$$$. The value in the $$$count$$$ array for position $$$3$$$ is $$$3$$$, for position $$$4$$$ it is $$$1$$$. -  The maximum value is reached only for position $$$3$$$, so the algorithm will uniquely select this position for number $$$4$$$. Satisfied with his purchase, Denis went home. For several days without a break, he generated permutations. He believes that he can come up with random permutations no worse than a generator. After that, he wrote out the first permutation that came to mind $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ and decided to find out if it could be obtained as a result of the generator.\nUnfortunately, this task was too difficult for him, and he asked you for help. It is necessary to define whether the written permutation could be obtained using the described algorithm if the generator always selects the position Denis needs.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains a single integer $$$t$$$ $$$(1 \\leq t \\leq 10^5)$$$ \u00a0\u2014 the number of test cases. Then the descriptions of the test cases follow.\nThe first line of the test case contains a single integer $$$n$$$ $$$(1 \\leq n \\leq 10^5)$$$ \u00a0\u2014 the size of the permutation.\nThe second line of the test case contains $$$n$$$ different integers $$$p_1, p_2, \\ldots, p_n$$$ ($$$1 \\leq p_i \\leq n$$$) \u00a0\u2014 the permutation written by Denis.\nIt is guaranteed that the sum of $$$n$$$ over all test cases doesn't exceed $$$10^5$$$.\n\nOutput\nPrint \"Yes\" if this permutation could be obtained as a result of the generator. Otherwise, print \"No\".\nAll letters can be displayed in any case.\n\nExample\nInput\n5\n5\n2 3 4 5 1\n1\n1\n3\n1 3 2\n4\n4 2 3 1\n5\n1 5 2 4 3\n\n\nOutput\nYes\nYes\nNo\nYes\nNo\n\n\n\n\nNote\nLet's simulate the operation of the generator in the first test.\nAt the $$$1$$$ step, $$$r = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], count = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$$$. The maximum value is reached in any free position, so the generator can choose a random position from $$$1$$$ to $$$5$$$. In our example, it chose $$$5$$$.\nAt the $$$2$$$ step, $$$r = [1, 2, 3, 4, \\times], count = [1, 1, 1, 1, 0]$$$. The maximum value is reached in positions from $$$1$$$ to $$$4$$$, so the generator can choose a random position among them.

The maximum value is $$$2$$$ and is reached only at the $$$2$$$ position, so the generator will choose this position.\nAt the $$$4$$$ step, $$$r = [3, 3, 3, 4, \\times], count = [0, 0, 3, 1, 0]$$$.

If a loop is present, return the data of the first node of the loop; otherwise, return -1.\\n\\n**Step 2: Identify the approach**\\n\\nTo solve this problem, we can use the Floyd\\'s Tortoise and Hare algorithm, also known as the \"tortoise and the hare\" algorithm. This algorithm uses two pointers that move at different speeds through the linked list. If there is a loop, these two pointers will eventually meet at some node within the loop.\\n\\n**Step 3: Implement the solution**\\n\\n```python\\nclass Node:\\n    def __init__(self, data):\\n        self.data = data\\n        self.next = None\\n\\ndef findFirstNode(head):\\n    tortoise = head\\n    hare = head\\n    \\n    while tortoise and hare and hare.next:\\n        tortoise = tortoise.next\\n        hare = hare.next.next\\n        \\n        if tortoise == hare:\\n            break\\n    \\n    if not tortoise or not hare or not hare.next:\\n        return -1\\n    \\n    tortoise = head\\n    while tortoise != hare:\\n        tortoise = tortoise.next\\n        hare = hare.next\\n    \\n    return tortoise.data\\n\\n# Example usage\\nhead = Node(1)\\nhead.next = Node(2)\\nhead.next.next = Node(3)\\nhead.next.next.next = Node(4)\\nhead.next.next.next.next = head.next  # Create a loop\\n\\nprint(findFirstNode(head))  # Output: 3\\n```\\n\\n**Step 4: Explain the code**\\n\\nThe code defines a `Node` class to represent each node in the linked list. The `findFirstNode` function takes the head of the linked list as input and returns the data of the first node of the loop if it exists; otherwise, it returns -1.\\n\\nThe function uses two pointers, `tortoise` and `hare`, which move at different speeds through the linked list. If there is a loop, these two pointers will eventually meet at some node within the loop. If no loop is found, the function returns -1.\\n\\n**Step 5: Provide the final answer**\\n\\nThe final answer is 3.', 17.532971382141113)",

Each part consists of n vertices; i-th vertex of part A is denoted as A_{i}, and i-th vertex of part B is denoted as B_{i}.\nFor each index i (1\u2009\u2264\u2009i\u2009<\u2009n) there is a directed edge from vertex A_{i} to vertex A_{i\u2009+\u20091}, and from B_{i} to B_{i\u2009+\u20091}, respectively. Capacities of these edges are given in the input. Also there might be several directed edges going from part A to part B (but never from B to A).\nYou have to calculate the maximum flow value from A_{1} to B_{n} in this network. Capacities of edges connecting A_{i} to A_{i\u2009+\u20091} might sometimes change, and you also have to maintain the maximum flow value after these changes. Apart from that, the network is fixed (there are no changes in part B, no changes of edges going from A to B, and no edge insertions or deletions).\nTake a look at the example and the notes to understand the structure of the network better.\n\nInput\nThe first line contains three integer numbers n, m and q (2\u2009\u2264\u2009n,\u2009m\u2009\u2264\u20092\u00b710^{5}, 0\u2009\u2264\u2009q\u2009\u2264\u20092\u00b710^{5}) \u2014 the number of vertices in each part, the number of edges going from A to B and the number of changes, respectively.\nThen n\u2009-\u20091 lines follow, i-th line contains two integers x_{i} and y_{i} denoting that the edge from A_{i} to A_{i\u2009+\u20091} has capacity x_{i} and the edge from B_{i} to B_{i\u2009+\u20091} has capacity y_{i} (1\u2009\u2264\u2009x_{i},\u2009y_{i}\u2009\u2264\u200910^{9}).\nThen m lines follow, describing the edges from A to B.

There might be multiple edges from A_{x} to B_{y}.\nAnd then q lines follow, describing a sequence of changes to the network. i-th line contains two integers v_{i} and w_{i}, denoting that the capacity of the edge from A_{vi} to A_{vi\u2009+\u20091} is set to w_{i} (1\u2009\u2264\u2009v_{i}\u2009<\u2009n, 1\u2009\u2264\u2009w_{i}\u2009\u2264\u200910^{9}).\n\nOutput\nFirstly, print the maximum flow value in the original network.

            "question": "Reordering the Documents\n\n  Susan is good at arranging her dining table for convenience, but not her office desk.\n\n  Susan has just finished the paperwork on a set of documents, which are still piled on her desk. They have serial numbers and were stacked in order when her boss brought them in. The ordering, however, is not perfect now, as she has been too lazy to put the documents slid out of the pile back to their proper positions. Hearing that she has finished, the boss wants her to return the documents immediately in the document box he is sending her. The documents should be stowed in the box, of course, in the order of their serial numbers.\n\n  The desk has room just enough for two more document piles where Susan plans to make two temporary piles. All the documents in the current pile are to be moved one by one from the top to either of the two temporary piles. As making these piles too tall in haste would make them tumble, not too many documents should be placed on them. After moving all the documents to the temporary piles and receiving the document box, documents in the two piles will be moved from their tops, one by one, into the box. Documents should be in reverse order of their serial numbers in the two piles to allow moving them to the box in order.\n\n  For example, assume that the pile has six documents #1, #3, #4, #2, #6, and #5, in this order from the top, and that the temporary piles can have no more than three documents. Then, she can form two temporary piles, one with documents #6, #4, and #3, from the top, and the other with #5, #2, and #1 (Figure E.1). Both of the temporary piles are reversely ordered. Then, comparing the serial numbers of documents on top of the two temporary piles, one with the larger number (#6, in this case) is to be removed and stowed into the document box first. Repeating this, all the documents will be perfectly ordered in the document box.\n\n![image](1.png)\n  Figure E.1. Making two temporary piles\n\n  Susan is wondering whether the plan is actually feasible with the documents in the current pile and, if so, how many different ways of stacking them to two temporary piles would do. You are asked to help Susan by writing a program to compute the number of different ways, which should be zero if the plan is not feasible.\n\n  As each of the documents in the pile can be moved to either of the two temporary piles, for $n$ documents, there are $2^n$ different choice combinations in total, but some of them may disturb the reverse order of the temporary piles and are thus inappropriate.\n\n  The example described above corresponds to the first case of the sample input. In this case, the last two documents, #5 and #6, can be swapped their destinations. Also, exchanging the roles of two temporary piles totally will be OK. As any other move sequences would make one of the piles higher than three and/or make them out of order, the total number of different ways of stacking documents to temporary piles in this example is $2 \\times 2 = 4$.\n\nInput\n\n  The input consists of a single test case of the following format.\n\n$n$ $m$\n$s_1$ ...  $s_n$\n\n  \n  Here, $n$ is the number of documents in the pile ($1 \\leq n \\leq 5000$), and $m$ is the number of documents that can be stacked in one temporary pile without committing risks of making it tumble down ($n/2 \\leq m \\leq n$). Numbers $s_1$ through $s_n$ are the serial numbers of the documents in the document pile, from its top to its bottom. It is guaranteed that all the numbers $1$ through $n$ appear exactly once.\n\nOutput\n\n  Output a single integer in a line which is the number of ways to form two temporary piles suited for the objective. When no choice will do, the number of ways is $0$, of course.\n\n  If the number of possible ways is greater than or equal to $10^9 + 7$, output the number of ways modulo $10^9 + 7$.\n\nSample Input 1 \n\n6 3\n1 3 4 2 6 5\n\nSample Output 1\n\n4\n\nSample Input 2 \n\n6 6\n1 3 4 2 6 5\n\nSample Output 2\n\n8\n\nSample Input 3 \n\n4 4\n4 3 1 2\n\nSample Output 3\n\n0\n\n\nPlease use a python program to solve this problem\n\nexample_input:\n6 3\n1 3 4 2 6 5\n\n\nexample_output:\n4\n\n\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

We can use a greedy approach to solve this problem.\\n\\n**Step 5: Find the Solution**\\n\\nWe can start by sorting the points in non-decreasing order of their $x$-coordinates. Then, we can iterate through the sorted points and erase them one by one. For each point, we can calculate the cost of erasing it using the second operation and compare it with the cost of drawing a triangle that covers the point. If the cost of erasing the point is less than the cost of drawing a triangle, we erase the point. Otherwise, we draw a triangle that covers the point.\\n\\n**Step 6: Write the Code**\\n\\nHere is the Python code to solve the problem:\\n\\n```python\\nimport sys\\n\\ndef solve():\\n    n, k, A = map(int, input().split())\\n    points = []\\n    for _ in range(n):\\n        x, y, c = map(int, input().split())\\n        points.append((x, y, c))\\n\\n    points.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])\\n\\n    total_cost = 0\\n    i = 0\\n    while i < n:\\n        x, y, c = points[i]\\n        cost = c\\n        j = i + 1\\n        while j < n and points[j][0] == x:\\n            cost += points[j][2]\\n            j += 1\\n        if cost < A:\\n            total_cost += cost\\n            i = j\\n        else:\\n            total_cost += A\\n            i += 1\\n\\n    print(total_cost)\\n\\nsolve()\\n```\\n\\n**Step 7: Test the Code**\\n\\nYou can test the code using the provided example inputs and outputs.\\n\\n**Step 8: Provide the Final Answer**\\n\\nThe final answer is 4.', 20.593108415603638)",

            "question": "# Problem Description\nThis problem involves a grid-based transformation where we need to simulate the absorption of orange dots by purple lines emanating from a red triangle. The goal is to calculate the minimum number of iterations required to convert all orange dots into purple dots, following specific geometric rules of absorption.\n\n# Visual Facts\n1. **Grid Structure:**\n   - The grid is a 4x4 coordinate system (0-3 on both axes).\n   - Grid points are discrete integer coordinates.\n   - The origin (0,0) is at the top-left corner.\n\n2. **Components:**\n   - One red triangle (fixed position).\n   - Multiple orange dots (initial state).\n   - Purple dots (transformed state).\n   - Purple lines (transformation medium).\n\n3. **Transformation Sequence:**\n   - Initial state shows orange dots and one red triangle.\n   - Iter1: Vertical line absorption.\n   - Iter2: Diagonal line absorption.\n   - Iter3: Horizontal line absorption.\n   - Iter4: Final vertical absorption.\n   - Process completes in exactly 4 iterations in the example.\n\n# Visual Patterns\n1. **Line Properties:**\n   - Each purple line must pass through the red triangle.\n   - Lines can be:\n     * Vertical (constant x).\n     * Horizontal (constant y).\n     * Diagonal (linear with slope).\n   - The line has only one direction, emitting from the red triangle.\n\n2. **Absorption Rules:**\n   - Any orange dot lying exactly on a purple line gets absorbed.\n   - Multiple dots can be absorbed in a single iteration if they lie on the same line.\n   - Each dot can only be absorbed once.\n   - The line must pass through both the triangle and at least one orange dot.\n   - The line is emitted unidirectionally from the red triangle. For example, if two purple points and the red triangle are on the same horizontal line, but one is to the left of the triangle and the other to the right, the triangle needs to emit two lines to absorb them.\n   - Example\uff1a\n      red_triangle=(3, 1), orange_dots=[(3, 0), (3, 2), (3, 3)]\n      The orange dots and the red triangle share the same x-coordinate (3), but have different y-coordinates. It can be observed that (3, 0) and the other two orange dots are not on the same side.\n      To convert the three orange dots, the red triangle needs to emit a purple line to (3, 0) first, and then emit another purple line to (3, 2) and (3, 3). Therefore, it takes a total of two iterations to convert them.\n\n\n3. **Optimization Patterns:**\n   - Lines are chosen to maximize the number of dots absorbed per iteration.\n   - Dots that share geometric alignment (same x, y, or slope relative to triangle) should be absorbed together.\n   - The order of absorption can affect the total number of iterations.\n   - Priority seems to be given to lines that can absorb multiple dots simultaneously.\n\n4. **Mathematical Constraints:**\n   - For dots to be absorbed in the same iteration, they must satisfy one of:\n     * Same x-coordinate as triangle (vertical line).\n     * Same y-coordinate as triangle (horizontal line).\n     * Share the same slope relative to triangle position (diagonal line).\n     * Points must be collinear with the triangle.\n\n5. **Iteration Strategy:**\n   - Given the red triangle's position (x0, y0):\n     - Traverse all the orange dots and classify each dot into a group according to the following rule.\n     - Find the dots with xi=x0 and y>y0, these points belong to the same group.\n     - Find the dots with xi=x0 and y<y0, these points belong to the same group.\n     - Find the dots with yi=y0 and x>x0, these points belong to the same group.\n     - Find the dots with yi=y0 and x<x0, these points belong to the same group.\n     - Then compute all the slopes to the orange dots (yi-y0)/(xi-x0).\n     - Slopes that are equal and have y > y0 belong to the same group, while slopes that are equal and have y<y0 belong to another group.\n     - The total iteration is the number of groups.\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

The ball follows the law of reflection (angle of incidence equals angle of reflection) when it hits the boundaries.\n\n# Visual Facts\n1. The coordinate system is a 10x10 grid (from 0 to 10 on both axes)\n2. The grid has clear boundaries at x=0, x=10, y=0, and y=10\n3. Start point (green circle) is located around (8, 7)\n4.

The path shows multiple bounces off the boundaries\n8. The path eventually reaches the target point\n9. The path follows straight lines between bounces\n\n# Visual Patterns\n1. Bouncing Pattern:\n   - When the ball hits a boundary, it reflects with equal angles\n   - The angle of reflection equals the angle of incidence\n   - The ball maintains constant direction between bounces\n\n2. Movement Constraints:\n   - Movement is continuous along straight lines\uff08x += dx\uff0cy += dy\uff09\n   - Direction changes only occur at boundaries\n   - The path never passes through the same point with the same direction twice (suggests a termination condition)\n\n3. Geometric Properties:\n   - The trajectory forms a series of connected line segments\n   - Each bounce preserves the angle but reverses one component of the direction vector\n   - For example, if the original direction (dx, dy) is (1, 1), and the x boundary is encountered (x == 0 or x == 10), then dx = -dx, and the new direction becomes (-1, 1).\n   - For example, if the original direction (dx, dy) is (1, 1), and the y boundary is encountered (y == 0 or y == 10), then dy = -dy, and the new direction becomes (1, -1).\n   - The path remains within the 10x10 grid boundaries at all times\n\n4.
