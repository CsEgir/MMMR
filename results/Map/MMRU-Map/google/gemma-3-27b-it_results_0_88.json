Shooting clubs are generally not known for being particularly \"beautiful\" in a wedding sense, though the convention hall *could* be well-equipped. It's a viable option, but not the most convenient or aesthetically promising.\n\n2.  **Ananda Bhaban Community Center:** Community centers are typically more basic and less aesthetically pleasing than dedicated convention centers. While they can accommodate a large number of people, they often lack the \"beautiful\" and \"well-equipped\" qualities the user is looking for.\n\n3.  **Celebrity Convention Center:** This is a dedicated convention center, suggesting it's designed for events like weddings and is likely to be well-equipped. The name \"Celebrity\" implies a certain level of quality and aesthetics.\n\n4.  **Emmanuelle's Convention Center:** Located in Dhanmondi (as shown on the map), this is the most convenient option. Convention centers are generally well-equipped, and \"Emmanuelle's\" suggests a focus on style and elegance.\n\n**Considering the map:**\n\nThe map shows Emmanuelle's Convention Center is directly within Dhanmondi, making it the most accessible option. The other venues are further away.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nGiven the criteria of being beautiful, well-equipped, accommodating a large number of guests, *and* being conveniently located in or near Dhanmondi, **Emmanuelle's Convention Center** is the best choice.\n\n\\boxed{Emmanuelle's Convention Center}",

However, it's not the most convenient *after* playing at Dhanmondi Abahani Field.\n*   **Kacchi Bhai - Dhanmondi:** This is a restaurant, not a hospital.

It's the most convenient option to visit *after* playing.\n\nConsidering the person wants to check their blood pressure *after* the game, minimizing travel time from the field is crucial. IBN Sina Specialized Hospital is the closest.
