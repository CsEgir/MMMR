I'll describe the path using coordinates, assuming the green start point is at (0,0) and moving right and up increases the coordinates.\n\n1. **Start:** (0,0) - Green\n\n2. **Move Up:** The path leads directly upwards.\n\n3. **Move Right:**  Follow the path to the right, avoiding the gray obstacles.\n\n4. **Move Up:** Continue moving upwards.\n\n5. **Move Right:** Move right again, navigating around the obstacles.\n\n6. **Move Up:** Move up to reach the gold end point.\n\nTherefore, the solution involves a series of up and right movements.  The exact coordinates are difficult to give without a numbered grid, but the general direction is clear from the image.\n\n\n\\boxed{answer}  The path is generally upwards and to the right, avoiding the charcoal gray obstacles.  A precise coordinate-based solution requires a grid overlay on the image.\n",
