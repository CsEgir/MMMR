Gulshan Shooting Club (Convention Hall) - Located in the Gulshan area, which is northeast of Dhanmondi\n2. Ananda Bhaban Community Center - Not clearly visible on the map\n3. Celebrity Convention Center - Not clearly visible on the map\n4. Emmanuelle's Convention Center - Visible on the map in the Dhanmondi area\n\nEmmanuelle's Convention Center appears to be the closest option to your current location in Dhanmondi. I can see it marked on the map in the southern part of Dhanmondi. There also appears to be \"Emmanuelle's Party Center\" in Gulshan 1, which might be related.\n\nFor a wedding venue, proximity is important for logistics, and Emmanuelle's Convention Center would provide that convenience. It's likely well-equipped for weddings as convention centers typically have the necessary facilities for large events. Being in Dhanmondi, it would be more accessible for you during planning visits and for your local guests.\n\n\\boxed{Emmanuelle's Convention Center}",
