These roads are located south of the starting point, as seen on the map.\n\n- The fourth option involves heading east, which is the opposite direction from the first three options. It includes turning onto \u664f\u5bb6\u576a\u4e1c\u8def/G212/G248 and then onto \u664f\u5bb6\u576a\u5317\u8def.\n\nGiven the map, the roads mentioned in the fourth option (\u664f\u5bb6\u576a\u4e1c\u8def and \u664f\u5bb6\u576a\u5317\u8def) are located east of the starting point.
