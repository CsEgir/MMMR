This does not match the original image.\n   - Option B: [1, 2, 0, 3] - This would place the mountains at the top, followed by the sky, then the beach/ocean, and finally more sky.

On top of this base, there is a triangular shape that extends upwards and outwards from the center of the base.\n\n3. **Determine the Top View Features**:\n   - The base will appear as a rectangle.\n   - The cutout in the middle will be visible as a smaller rectangle within the larger rectangle.\n   - The triangular shape on top will project downwards and appear as a triangle within the larger rectangle, but it will not obscure the cutout completely.\n\n4. **Compare with the Options**:\n   - **Option A**: Shows a rectangle with a smaller rectangle cutout in the middle, but no triangular shape is visible. This does not match the top view.\n   - **Option B**: Shows a rectangle with a smaller rectangle cutout in the middle and a triangular shape that fits the description of the top view. This matches the top view.\n   - **Option C**: Shows a rectangle with a smaller rectangle cutout in the middle and a triangular shape, but the triangular shape is not correctly positioned.

As the game progresses, the boy becomes increasingly agitated and starts to kick the table with his feet.

In the final panel, the man stands up abruptly, causing the boy to fall to the floor.

As he flees, three children notice the commotion and decide to intervene. They quickly grab paintbrushes and begin painting the chair's face with various expressions, including a smile and a frown. The man, now sitting on the chair, seems oblivious to the children's antics as they continue to decorate his seat. Eventually, one of the children steps back to admire their handiwork, while the other two laugh at the absurdity of the situation.

As they continue, the man switches to a violin, and the child joins in with a small instrument. The man then picks up a flute, and the child does the same.
