The top view confirms this, showing two rectangles side by side, one larger than the other.\n\nNow, let's examine the options:\n\nA) A simple rectangle with no tiers or steps.\nB) A rectangle with a smaller rectangle on top, matching the front view.\nC) A rectangle with a larger rectangle on top, contradicting the front view.\nD) A rectangle with a smaller rectangle on the side, not matching the front or top views.\n\nBased on the analysis, option B is the only one that matches both the front and top views. Therefore, the correct left view of the solid is:\n\n\\boxed{B}",
