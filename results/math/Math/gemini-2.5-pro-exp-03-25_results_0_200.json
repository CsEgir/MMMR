Since AB // CD, corresponding angles are equal.\n    6.  Therefore, ∠2 = ∠CFE = 130°.\n\n*   **Method 2: Using Alternate Interior Angles and Linear Pair**\n    1.  Let ∠DFE be the angle vertically opposite to ∠1. Vertically opposite angles are equal.\n    2.  Therefore, ∠DFE = ∠1 = 50°.\n    3.  Angle ∠DFE and angle ∠AEF are alternate interior angles. Since AB // CD, alternate interior angles are equal.\n    4.  Therefore, ∠AEF = ∠DFE = 50°.\n    5.  Angle 2 and angle ∠AEF form a linear pair on the line AB.\n    6.  Therefore, ∠2 + ∠AEF = 180°.\n    7.  Substituting the value of ∠AEF: ∠2 + 50° = 180°.\n    8.  Solving for ∠2: ∠2 = 180° - 50° = 130°.\n\n*   **Method 3: Using Consecutive Interior Angles**\n    1.  Let ∠AEF be the angle adjacent to ∠2 on the line AB. Angles ∠2 and ∠AEF form a linear pair.\n    2.  Let the angle corresponding to ∠1 be ∠AEF'. This angle is below AB and to the right of the transversal. ∠AEF' = ∠1 = 50°.\n    3.  Angle ∠AEF and ∠AEF' are vertically opposite to ∠2 and the angle adjacent to ∠2 respectively.\n    4.  Consider the interior angle on the same side as ∠1, which is ∠AEF. Angle 1 is an exterior angle. The interior angle on the same side is ∠AEF. The exterior angle ∠1 and the interior angle ∠AEF are supplementary if the lines are parallel. No, this relationship is not standard.\n    5.  Let's use the angle ∠CFE calculated in Method 1. ∠CFE = 130°. Angle ∠CFE and Angle ∠AEF are alternate interior angles. No, ∠CFE and ∠BEF are alternate interior angles. ∠CFE and ∠AEF are consecutive interior angles (same-side interior angles).\n    6.  Since AB // CD, consecutive interior angles are supplementary.\n    7.  ∠CFE + ∠AEF = 180°. We found ∠CFE = 130°. So, 130° + ∠AEF = 180°, which gives ∠AEF = 50°.\n    8.  Angle 2 and ∠AEF form a linear pair. So, ∠2 + ∠AEF = 180°.\n    9.  ∠2 + 50° = 180°.\n    10. ∠2 =",

Since the sun's rays are considered parallel, the angle of elevation of the sun is the same for both Xiaoliang and the tree. This means the triangle formed by Xiaoliang and his shadow is similar to the triangle formed by the tree and its shadow.\n2.  **Identifying Given Information:**\n    *   Xiaoliang's height (let's call it H_x) = 1.8 (units assumed meters).\n    *   Xiaoliang's shadow length (let's call it S_x) = 1.5 (units assumed meters).\n    *   Tree's shadow length (BC, let's call it S_t) = 9 (units assumed meters, as indicated in the figure).\n    *   We need to find the tree's height (AB, let's call it H_t).\n3.  **Setting up the Proportion:** Because the triangles are similar, the ratio of the height to the shadow length is the same for both Xiaoliang and the tree.\n    H_t / S_t = H_x / S_x\n4.  **Substituting the Values:**\n    H_t / 9 = 1.8 / 1.5\n5.  **Solving for H_t (Tree Height AB):**\n    H_t = 9 * (1.8 / 1.5)\n    To simplify the fraction 1.8 / 1.5, we can multiply the numerator and denominator by 10:\n    1.8 / 1.5 = 18 / 15\n    Now, simplify the fraction 18 / 15 by dividing both by their greatest common divisor, which is 3:\n    18 / 15 = (18 ÷ 3) / (15 ÷ 3) = 6 / 5\n    Alternatively, calculate the decimal value: 1.8 / 1.5 = 1.2\n    Now substitute back into the equation for H_t:\n    H_t = 9 * (6 / 5) = 54 / 5\n    Or using the decimal:\n    H_t = 9 * 1.2\n    Calculate the final value:\n    H_t = 54 / 5 = 10.8\n    H_t = 9 * 1.2 = 10.8\n6.  **Conclusion:** The height of the tree AB is 10.8 meters.\n7.  **Matching with Choices:** Comparing the calculated height (10.8m) with the given choices:\n    A: 10.8m\n    B: 9m\n    C: 7.5m\n    D: 0.3m\n    The calculated height matches choice A.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{10.8m}}$",

This ratio is OA / OA′.\n    Scale factor (from smaller to larger) = OA / OA′ = (3x) / (2x) = 3/2.\n    Alternatively, the scale factor from the larger figure to the smaller figure is OA′ / OA = (2x) / (3x) = 2/3.\n\n*   **Relating Areas of Similar Figures:** The ratio of the areas of two similar figures is equal to the square of their scale factor (ratio of corresponding lengths).\n    Ratio of areas = (Area of ABCD) / (Area of A′B′C′D′) = (Scale factor from smaller to larger)²\n    (Area of ABCD) / (Area of A′B′C′D′) = (OA / OA′)² = (3/2)² = 9/4.\n\n*   **Calculating the Area of ABCD:** We are given that the area of quadrilateral A′B′C′D′ is 12.0. Let Area(A′B′C′D′) = 12.0.\n    Using the relationship derived above:\n    Area(ABCD) / 12.0 = 9/4\n    Multiply both sides by 12.0:\n    Area(ABCD) = (9/4) * 12.0\n    Area(ABCD) = 9 * (12.0 / 4)\n    Area(ABCD) = 9 * 3.0\n    Area(ABCD) = 27.0\n\n*   **Comparing with Choices:** The calculated area of quadrilateral ABCD is 27.0. The choices are A: 24 cm², B: 27 cm², C: 36 cm², D: 54 cm². Assuming the unit is cm², our result matches choice B.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\text{27cm^{2}}}$",

    "output": "*   **Understanding Perpendicular Bisectors and Circumcenter:** The lines l, m, and n are the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of triangle PQR. The point where the perpendicular bisectors intersect, point T, is called the circumcenter of the triangle. A key property of the circumcenter is that it is equidistant from the vertices of the triangle. Therefore, PT = QT = RT.\n\n*   **Using the Circumcenter Property:** We are given the lengths of the segments from the circumcenter T to the vertices:\n    *   TQ = 2x\n    *   PT = 3y - 1\n    *   TR = 8\n    Since PT = QT = RT, we can set these equal to each other:\n    *   PT = TR  =>  3y - 1 = 8  =>  3y = 9  =>  y = 3\n    *   QT = TR  =>  2x = 8  =>  x = 4\n    *   So, PT = QT = TR = 8.\n\n*   **Using the Perpendicular Bisector Definition:** Line l is the perpendicular bisector of side PR. This means that line l is perpendicular to PR and passes through the midpoint of PR.\n*   **Finding z:** The image shows that line l intersects PR at a point. This intersection point divides the segment PR into two parts. The length of the part from P to the intersection point is given as z + 4. The length of the part from the intersection point to R is given as 7. Since line l is the bisector of PR, it must divide PR into two equal segments. Therefore, the lengths of these two segments must be equal:\n    *   z + 4 = 7\n\n*   **Solving for z:** Subtract 4 from both sides of the equation:\n    *   z = 7 - 4\n    *   z = 3\n\n*   **Comparing with Choices:** The calculated value z = 3 matches choice A.\n\nThe final answer is $\\boxed{3}$",

This point appears to be at (7, 3). The horizontal distance between the center (1, 3) and this point (7, 3) is |7 - 1| = 6.\n    Let's look at the point directly below the center on the circle. This point appears to be at (1, -3). The vertical distance between the center (1, 3) and this point (1, -3) is |3 - (-3)| = |3 + 3| = 6.\n    Let's look at the point directly to the left of the center on the circle. This point appears to be at (-5, 3). The horizontal distance between the center (1, 3) and this point (-5, 3) is |1 - (-5)| = |1 + 5| = 6.\n    All these distances confirm that the radius r = 6.\n\n3.  **Write the equation in standard form:**\n    Substitute the values of h, k, and r into the standard form equation:\n    (x - h)^2 + (y - k)^2 = r^2\n    (x - 1)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 6^2\n    (x - 1)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 36\n\nThe equation of the circle in standard form is (x - 1)^2 + (y - 3)^2 = 36.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{(x-1)^2 + (y-3)^2 = 36}$",

This is the equation of a circle centered at the origin (0, 0) with a radius r = √9 = 3.\n    *   The second equation is y = x² - 4. This is the equation of a parabola that opens upwards and has its vertex at (0, -4).\n\n*   **Analyze the graph:**\n    *   The provided image shows the graphs of the circle and the parabola plotted on the same coordinate system.\n    *   The solutions to the system of equations are the points where the two graphs intersect.\n    *   By visually inspecting the graph, we can see that the parabola intersects the circle at four distinct points: one in each of the four quadrants.\n\n*   **Algebraic Verification (Optional but confirms the visual interpretation):**\n    *   Substitute the expression for y from the second equation into the first equation:\n        x² + (x² - 4)² = 9\n    *   Expand the squared term:\n        x² + (x⁴ - 8x² + 16) = 9\n    *   Combine like terms and set the equation to zero:\n        x⁴ - 7x² + 16 - 9 = 0\n        x⁴ - 7x² + 7 = 0\n    *   This is a quartic equation in x, but it's quadratic in form if we let u = x². The equation becomes:\n        u² - 7u + 7 = 0\n    *   Use the quadratic formula to solve for u:\n        u = [ -(-7) ± √((-7)² - 4 * 1 * 7) ] / (2 * 1)\n        u = [ 7 ± √(49 - 28) ] / 2\n        u = [ 7 ± √21 ] / 2\n    *   Since u = x², we have two possible values for x²:\n        x² = (7 + √21) / 2\n        x² = (7 - √21) / 2\n    *   We need to check if these values for x² are positive. Since √21 is approximately 4.58, both (7 + √21)/2 and (7 - √21)/2 are positive numbers.\n        (7 + √21)/2 ≈ (7 + 4.58)/2 ≈ 5.79 > 0\n        (7 - √21)/2 ≈ (7 - 4.58)/2 ≈ 1.21 > 0\n    *   Since both values for x² are positive, each gives two distinct real values for x:\n        x = ±√[(7 + √21) / 2]\n        x = ±√[(7 - √21) / 2]\n    *   This gives a total of four distinct real values for x. For each x², there is a corresponding y value (y = x² - 4).\n        When x² = (7 + √21)/2, y = (7 + √21)/2 - 4 = (-1 + √21)/2. This gives two solutions.\n        When x² = (7 - √21)/2, y = (7 - √21)/2 - 4 = (-1 - √21)/2. This gives two more solutions.\n    *   Therefore, there are four distinct real solutions (x, y) to the system.\n\n*   **Conclusion:**\n    *   Both the graphical analysis and the algebraic solution show that there are four points of intersection, meaning the",

This is always true for lines but doesn't prove parallelism.\n    *   (B) $\\angle CFB \\cong \\angle GEF$: $\\angle GEF$ is a straight angle (180°). $\\angle CFB$ is an angle in a triangle, so it's < 180°. This cannot be true.\n    *   (C) $\\angle DAB \\cong \\angle FGE$: These are straight angles (180°). Doesn't prove parallelism.\n    *   (D) $\\angle ABF \\cong \\angle BFC$: $\\angle ABF$ is an exterior angle, $\\angle BFC$ is an interior angle of the triangle. Not a standard pair for proving parallel lines.\n    *   (E) $\\angle EFB \\cong \\angle CFB$: These are adjacent angles on line EFG. Doesn't prove parallelism.\n    *   (F) $\\angle CBF \\cong \\angle GFC$: $\\angle CBF$ uses transversal BF. $\\angle GFC$ uses transversal CF. Not related by a single transversal.\n    *   (G) $\\angle CFG \\cong \\angle FCB$: These are **alternate interior angles** formed by the transversal CF intersecting lines ABCD and EFG. If alternate interior angles are congruent, the lines are parallel. This statement works.\n    *   (H) $\\angle BCF \\cong \\angle GFE$: $\\angle GFE$ is a straight angle (180°). $\\angle BCF$ is an angle in a triangle (< 180°). Cannot be true.\n    *   (I) $\\angle FCB \\cong \\angle GEC$: $\\angle GEC$ is not a standard angle formed by the transversals shown.\n    *   (J) $\\angle BAF \\cong \\angle FCG$: These angles involve points A and G and don't form a standard pair for proving parallel lines with the given transversals.\n\n*   **Conclusion:** The statement $\\angle CFG \\cong \\angle FCB$ establishes the congruence of alternate interior angles formed by transversal CF. By the Converse of the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem, this proves $\\overline{ABCD} \\parallel \\overline{EFG}$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{\\angle CFG \\cong \\angle FCB}$",

Herc's trajectory is a parabola until he catches the vertical safety net, on his way down, at point $B$. Point $B$ is $64 \\mathrm{~m}$ directly above point $C$ on the floor of the tent. If Herc reaches a maximum height of $100 \\mathrm{~m}$, directly above a point $30 \\mathrm{~m}$ from the cannon, determine the horizontal distance from the cannon to the net.",
    "output": "Let the position of the cannon be the origin (0, 0) in a Cartesian coordinate system, where the x-axis represents the horizontal ground level and the y-axis represents the vertical height.\n\nHerc's trajectory is described as a parabola. The general equation for a parabola opening downwards with vertex $(h, k)$ is $y = a(x-h)^2 + k$.\n\nFrom the problem statement:\n1.  Herc reaches a maximum height of 100 m. This means the y-coordinate of the vertex is $k = 100$.\n2.  This maximum height occurs directly above a point 30 m from the cannon. This means the x-coordinate of the vertex is $h = 30$.\nSo, the vertex of the parabola is $(h, k) = (30, 100)$.\n\nThe equation of the parabola becomes $y = a(x-30)^2 + 100$.\n\nThe cannon is at ground level, which corresponds to the point (0, 0). Since Herc is fired from the cannon, the point (0, 0) must lie on the parabola. We can use this point to find the value of the constant 'a'.\nSubstitute $x=0$ and $y=0$ into the equation:\n$0 = a(0-30)^2 + 100$\n$0 = a(-30)^2 + 100$\n$0 = a(900) + 100$\n$-100 = 900a$\n$a = -\\frac{100}{900} = -\\frac{1}{9}$\n\nSo, the equation of Herc's trajectory is $y = -\\frac{1}{9}(x-30)^2 + 100$.\n\nHerc catches the vertical safety net at point B. Point B is $64 \\mathrm{~m}$ directly above point C on the floor. This means the height of point B is $y = 64$. Let the horizontal distance from the cannon to the net be $x_N$. Point C is at $(x_N, 0)$ and point B is at $(x_N, 64)$.\n\nSince point B lies on the parabolic trajectory, its coordinates $(x_N, 64)$ must satisfy the equation of the parabola:\n$64 = -\\frac{1}{9}(x_N-30)^2 + 100$\n\nNow, we solve this equation for $x_N$:\n$64 - 100 = -\\frac{1}{9}(x_N-30)^2$\n$-36 = -\\frac{1}{9}(x_N-30)^2$\nMultiply both sides by -9:\n$(-36) \\times (-9) = (x_N-30)^2$\n$324 = (x_N-30)^2$\n\nTake the square root of both sides:\n$\\sqrt{324} = \\pm (x_N-30)$\n$18 = \\pm (x_N-30)$\n\nThis gives two possible solutions for $x_N$:\nCase 1: $18 = x_N - 30 \\implies x_N = 30 + 18 = 48$\nCase 2: $-18 = x_N - 30 \\implies x_N = 30 - 18 = 12$\n\nThe problem states that Herc catches the net \"on his way down\". The vertex (maximum height) occurs at $x = 30$. \"On his way down\" means that the horizontal distance $x_N$ must be greater than the x-coordinate of the vertex.\nTherefore, we must choose the solution where $x_N > 30$.\nComparing the two solutions, $x_N = 48$ is greater than 30, while $x_N = 12$ is less than 30. The point $(12, 64)$ represents Herc's position when he is at a height of 64 m on his way up. The point $(48, 64)$ represents Herc's position when he is at a height of 64 m on his way down (point B).\n\nThus, the horizontal distance from the cannon to the net is 48 m.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{48 \\text{ m}}$",

This means we are looking for expressions that represent the negative (opposite) of the tangent of the angle $\\theta$.\n\n**2. Key Trigonometric Identities:**\nWe will use fundamental trigonometric identities involving angle transformations:\n*   **Odd/Even Identity:** Tangent is an odd function, which means $\\tan(-\\alpha) = -\\tan(\\alpha)$.\n*   **Periodicity:** Tangent has a period of $\\pi$, meaning $\\tan(\\alpha + n\\pi) = \\tan(\\alpha)$ for any integer $n$.\n*   **Angle Subtraction/Addition:** $\\tan(\\pi - \\alpha) = \\frac{\\tan(\\pi) - \\tan(\\alpha)}{1 + \\tan(\\pi)\\tan(\\alpha)}$. Since $\\tan(\\pi) = 0$, this simplifies to $\\tan(\\pi - \\alpha) = \\frac{0 - \\tan(\\alpha)}{1 + 0} = -\\tan(\\alpha)$.\n*   **Angle Subtraction:** $\\tan(\\alpha - \\pi) = \\tan(\\alpha - \\pi + \\pi) = \\tan(\\alpha)$. Alternatively, $\\tan(\\alpha - \\pi) = \\tan(-(\\pi - \\alpha)) = -\\tan(\\pi - \\alpha) = -(-\\tan(\\alpha)) = \\tan(\\alpha)$.\n\n**3.

    "output": "Step-by-step derivation:\n1.  Consider the triangle $\\triangle ADC$. We are given the angles $\\angle DAC = 50^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle DCA = 65^{\\circ}$.\n2.  The sum of the angles in a triangle is $180^{\\circ}$. Therefore, the third angle in $\\triangle ADC$, $\\angle ADC$, can be calculated as:\n    $\\angle ADC = 180^{\\circ} - (\\angle DAC + \\angle DCA)$\n    $\\angle ADC = 180^{\\circ} - (50^{\\circ} + 65^{\\circ})$\n    $\\angle ADC = 180^{\\circ} - 115^{\\circ}$\n    $\\angle ADC = 65^{\\circ}$\n3.  Since $\\angle DCA = 65^{\\circ}$ and $\\angle ADC = 65^{\\circ}$, the triangle $\\triangle ADC$ has two equal angles. This means that $\\triangle ADC$ is an isosceles triangle.\n4.  In an isosceles triangle, the sides opposite the equal angles are equal in length. Therefore, the side opposite $\\angle ADC$ (which is AC) is equal to the side opposite $\\angle DAC$ (which is DC) is incorrect. The sides opposite the equal angles $\\angle DCA$ and $\\angle ADC$ are AD and AC, respectively. So, $AD = AC$.\n5.  We are given in the problem statement that $AD = BC$.\n6.  From step 4, we know $AD = AC$. Combining this with the given information $AD = BC$, we can conclude that $AC = BC$.\n7.  Now consider the triangle $\\triangle ABC$. Since $AC = BC$, $\\triangle ABC$ is an isosceles triangle with the base AB.\n8.  In an isosceles triangle, the angles opposite the equal sides are equal. Therefore, the angle opposite side BC (which is $\\angle BAC$) is equal to the angle opposite side AC (which is $\\angle ABC$). So, $\\angle ABC = \\angle BAC$.\n9.  We are given the angle $\\angle ACB = 70^{\\circ}$.\n10. The sum of the angles in $\\triangle ABC$ is $180^{\\circ}$. So, $\\angle ABC + \\angle BAC + \\angle ACB = 180^{\\circ}$.\n11. Substitute $\\angle BAC$ with $\\angle ABC$ (from step 8) and $\\angle ACB$ with $70^{\\circ}$ (given):\n    $\\angle ABC + \\angle ABC + 70^{\\circ} = 180^{\\circ}$\n    $2 \\times \\angle ABC + 70^{\\circ} = 180^{\\circ}$\n12. Solve for $\\angle ABC$:\n    $2 \\times \\angle ABC = 180^{\\circ} - 70^{\\circ}$\n    $2 \\times \\angle ABC = 110^{\\circ}$\n    $\\angle ABC = \\frac{110^{\\circ}}{2}$\n    $\\angle ABC = 55^{\\circ}$\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{55^{\\circ}}$",

The curves labeled a, b, c, and d represent loops based at a single point. These loops are the standard generators for the fundamental group of the genus 2 surface. Specifically, (a, b) generate the fundamental group related to the first handle, and (c, d) generate the fundamental group related to the second handle.\n\n2.  **Standard Presentation of Genus g Surface:** The fundamental group of a closed orientable surface of genus g, denoted $\\Sigma_g$, has a standard presentation given by:\n    $\\pi_1(\\Sigma_g, x_0) = \\langle a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2, \\dots, a_g, b_g \\mid [a_1, b_1][a_2, b_2]\\dots[a_g, b_g] = 1 \\rangle$\n    where $[x, y] = xyx^{-1}y^{-1}$ is the commutator.\n\n3.  **Apply to Genus 2:** For the given space, the genus is g = 2. So, the fundamental group presentation is:\n    $\\pi_1(\\Sigma_2, x_0) = \\langle a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2 \\mid [a_1, b_1][a_2, b_2] = 1 \\rangle$\n    Expanding the commutators, we get:\n    $\\pi_1(\\Sigma_2, x_0) = \\langle a_1, b_1, a_2, b_2 \\mid a_1 b_1 a_1^{-1} b_1^{-1} a_2 b_2 a_2^{-1} b_2^{-1} = 1 \\rangle$\n\n4.  **Match Generators:** Comparing the standard generators $(a_1, b_1)$ for the first handle and $(a_2, b_2)$ for the second handle with the labels in the diagram, we can identify $a_1 = a$, $b_1 = b$, $a_2 = c$, and $b_2 = d$.\n\n5.  **Substitute Generators:** Substituting these into the standard presentation for genus 2 gives:\n    $\\pi_1(\\Sigma_2, x_0) = \\langle a, b, c, d \\mid a b a^{-1} b^{-1} c d c^{-1} d^{-1} = 1 \\rangle$\n\n6.  **Verify with the Polygon (Right Diagram):** The right diagram shows a fundamental polygon (an octagon) for the genus 2 surface. Identifying the edges according to the labels and orientations yields the surface. The relation in the fundamental group presentation is obtained by traversing the boundary of the polygon starting from a vertex (which corresponds to the basepoint in the quotient space). Starting from the bottom-left vertex (marked with a dot) and moving counter-clockwise:\n    *   Traverse edge 'a' (forward): $a$\n    *   Traverse edge 'b' (forward): $b$\n    *   Traverse edge 'a' (backward): $a^{-1}$\n    *   Traverse edge 'b' (backward): $b^{-1}$\n    *   Traverse edge 'c' (forward): $c$\n    *   Traverse edge 'd' (forward): $d$\n    *   Traverse edge 'c' (backward): $c^{-1}$\n    *   Traverse edge 'd' (backward): $d^{-1}$\n    The product of these terms represents a loop that bounds the polygon, which becomes contractible in the surface. Therefore, the relation is:\n    $a b a^{-1} b^{-1} c d c^{-1} d^{-1} = 1$\n\n7.  **Compare with Options:** Comparing the derived presentation $\\langle a, b, c, d \\mid aba^{-1}b^{-1}cdc^{-1}d^{-1} = 1 \\rangle$ with the given options:\n    *   (A) $\\langle a, b, c, d \\mid aba^{-1}b^{-1}cdc^{-1}d^{-1} = 1 \\rangle$: Matches.\n    *   (B) $\\langle a, b, c, d \\mid abcd = 1 \\rangle$: Incorrect.\n    *   (C) $\\langle a, b, c, d \\mid a b a^{-1} c^{-1} d c d^{-1} b^{-1} = 1 \\rangle$: Incorrect.\n    *   (D) $\\langle a, b, c, d \\mid aba^{-1}b^{-1} cdc^{-1}d^{-1} = 1, a^2 b^2 c^2 d^2 = 1 \\rangle$: Incorrect (includes an extra relation).\n\nThus, the correct presentation is given by option (A).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{A}$",

    "output": "*   **Step 1: Identify the surface.** The image on the left depicts a torus. A torus is a surface shaped like a donut.\n*   **Step 2: Understand the generators.** The loops labeled 'a' and 'b' on the torus represent the generators of its fundamental group. Loop 'a' goes around the torus longitudinally (the long way), and loop 'b' goes around meridionally (the short way through the hole). These are the standard generators for the fundamental group of the torus.\n*   **Step 3: Understand the polygon representation.** The image on the right shows a square with edge identifications. This is a standard way to construct a torus topologically. Opposite sides are identified with the same orientation: the top edge 'a' is identified with the bottom edge 'a', and the left edge 'b' is identified with the right edge 'b'.\n*   **Step 4: Derive the fundamental group presentation from the polygon.** To find the presentation of the fundamental group from the polygon, we choose a vertex as the base point (e.g., the bottom-left vertex, marked with a dot). We then traverse the boundary of the polygon, reading off the edge labels. If we traverse an edge in the direction of its arrow, we write the generator; if we traverse against the arrow, we write the generator's inverse. Starting from the bottom-left vertex and moving counterclockwise:\n    *   Traverse the bottom edge: We move along 'a' in the direction of the arrow, so we write 'a'.\n    *   Traverse the right edge: We move along 'b' in the direction of the arrow, so we write 'b'.\n    *   Traverse the top edge: We move along 'a' against the direction of the arrow, so we write 'a⁻¹'.\n    *   Traverse the left edge: We move along 'b' against the direction of the arrow, so we write 'b⁻¹'.\n*   **Step 5: Form the relation.** The sequence of generators obtained by traversing the boundary is $aba^{-1}b^{-1}$. In the fundamental group, traversing the boundary of the polygon corresponds to a loop that is contractible (homotopic to the identity). Therefore, we set this sequence equal to the identity element: $aba^{-1}b^{-1} = e$.\n*   **Step 6: Write the group presentation.** The generators are 'a' and 'b', and the relation is $aba^{-1}b^{-1} = e$. Thus, the fundamental group presentation is $\\langle a, b \\mid aba^{-1}b^{-1} \\rangle$.\n*   **Step 7: Connect the two representations.** The square representation on the right constructs the torus shown on the left. The generators 'a' and 'b' derived from the square correspond directly to the loops 'a' and 'b' shown on the torus. The question asks for the presentation of the fundamental group of the torus (left) with the given generators 'a' and 'b'. This is precisely the group derived from the square representation. The phrase \"given the presentation of the fundamental group of the square on the right as $\\langle a, b \\mid aba^{-1}b^{-1} \\rangle$\" confirms that this standard derivation is expected.\n*   **Step 8: Compare with the options.** The derived presentation is $\\langle a, b \\mid aba^{-1}b^{-1} \\rangle$. This matches option (A).\n\nThe fundamental group of the torus, represented by the surface on the left or the identified square on the right, with generators a and b as shown, has the presentation $\\langle a, b \\mid aba^{-1}b^{-1} \\rangle$. This signifies that the generators commute ($ab = ba$).\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{A}$",
