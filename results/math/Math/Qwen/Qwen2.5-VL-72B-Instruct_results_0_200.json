Substituting \\(x^2 + y^2 = x\\) into the sphere's equation \\(x^2 + y^2 + z^2 = 1\\), we get:\n\n\\[\nx + z^2 = 1 \\implies z^2 = 1 - x\n\\]\n\nSince \\(x\\) ranges from 0 to 1 (the maximum value of \\(x\\) is 1 when \\(y = 0\\)), \\(z\\) ranges from \\(-\\sqrt{1 - x}\\) to \\(\\sqrt{1 - x}\\).\n\nThe surface area of the cylinder can be found by integrating the circumference of the circular cross-sections along the \\(z\\)-axis.

First, square each equation:\n1. \\(a^2 + b^2 = 55\\)\n2. \\(a^2 + c^2 = 64\\)\n3. \\(b^2 + c^2 = 81\\)\n\nAdd all three equations together:\n\\[ (a^2 + b^2) + (a^2 + c^2) + (b^2 + c^2) = 55 + 64 + 81 \\]\n\\[ 2a^2 + 2b^2 + 2c^2 = 200 \\]\n\\[ a^2 + b^2 + c^2 = 100 \\]\n\nNow, we can find \\(c^2\\) by subtracting the first equation from this result:\n\\[ (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^2 + b^2) = 100 - 55 \\]\n\\[ c^2 = 45 \\]\nSo, \\(c = \\sqrt{45} = 3\\sqrt{5}\\).\n\nNext, find \\(a^2\\) by subtracting the third equation from the result:\n\\[ (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (b^2 + c^2) = 100 - 81 \\]\n\\[ a^2 = 19 \\]\nSo, \\(a = \\sqrt{19}\\).\n\nFinally, find \\(b^2\\) by subtracting the second equation from the result:\n\\[ (a^2 + b^2 + c^2) - (a^2 + c^2) = 100 - 64 \\]\n\\[ b^2 = 36 \\]\nSo, \\(b = 6\\).\n\nThe length of the diagonal \\(XA\\) of the rectangular parallelepiped is given by:\n\\[ XA = \\sqrt{a^2 + b^2 + c^2} = \\sqrt{100} = 10 \\]\n\nThus, the length of the diagonal \\(XA\\) is \\(\\boxed{10}\\).",

    "output": "To determine the number of different triangles that can be formed by joining any 3 of the 15 equally spaced points on a circle, where congruent triangles (by rotation or reflection) are counted as only one triangle, we need to consider the symmetries of the circle.\n\nFirst, let's calculate the total number of triangles that can be formed without considering congruence. This is simply the number of ways to choose 3 points out of 15, which is given by the combination formula \\(\\binom{15}{3}\\):\n\n\\[\n\\binom{15}{3} = \\frac{15 \\times 14 \\times 13}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 455\n\\]\n\nNext, we need to account for the fact that some of these triangles are congruent by rotation or reflection. The key observation is that the number of distinct triangles is determined by the relative positions of the points, not their absolute positions. Specifically, we need to count the number of distinct sets of side lengths (or equivalently, the number of distinct sets of arc lengths between the points).\n\nFor a triangle formed by three points on a circle, the three arcs between the points can be denoted as \\(a\\), \\(b\\), and \\(c\\) such that \\(a + b + c = 15\\). Without loss of generality, we can assume \\(a \\leq b \\leq c\\). We need to count the number of solutions to this equation under these constraints.\n\nWe will list all possible sets \\((a, b, c)\\) such that \\(a + b + c = 15\\) and \\(a \\leq b \\leq c\\):\n\n- \\(a = 1\\): \\((1, 7, 7)\\)\n- \\(a = 2\\): \\((2, 6, 7)\\)\n- \\(a = 3\\): \\((3, 5, 7)\\), \\((3, 6, 6)\\)\n- \\(a = 4\\): \\((4, 4, 7)\\), \\((4, 5, 6)\\)\n- \\(a = 5\\): \\((5, 5, 5)\\)\n\nSo the distinct sets are: \\((1, 7, 7)\\), \\((2, 6, 7)\\), \\((3, 5, 7)\\), \\((3, 6, 6)\\), \\((4, 4, 7)\\), \\((4, 5, 6)\\), \\((5, 5, 5)\\).

Therefore, the vertices of the square are:\n- \\((1, 1)\\)\n- \\((2, 1)\\)\n- \\((2, 2)\\)\n- \\((1, 2)\\)\n\nNow, we apply the transformation \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{x}, \\frac{1}{y}\\right)\\) to each of these vertices:\n1.

This is because the transformation \\(\\left(\\frac{1}{x}, \\frac{1}{y}\\right)\\) maps straight lines to hyperbolas.\n\nBy examining the options provided, we see that option (B) shows a shape that matches this description.

We start by noting that the area of the square is 30 cm², so the area of each half of the square (split by the diagonal) is 15 cm².\n\nThe areas of the triangles formed by the additional lines are given as follows:\n- The triangle with area 2 cm².\n- The triangle with area 5 cm².\n- The triangle with area 9 cm².\n- The triangle with area 4 cm².\n\nSince the diagonal of the square splits it into two equal right triangles, each with an area of 15 cm², we can use the fact that the sum of the areas of the smaller triangles on each side of the diagonal must add up to 15 cm².\n\nLet's denote the length of the diagonal of the square as \\(d\\). The length of the diagonal of a square with side length \\(s\\) is given by \\(d = s\\sqrt{2}\\). Since the area of the square is 30 cm², the side length \\(s\\) is \\(\\sqrt{30}\\), so the length of the diagonal is \\(d = \\sqrt{30} \\cdot \\sqrt{2} = \\sqrt{60} = 2\\sqrt{15}\\).\n\nNow, let's consider the segments \\(a, b, c, d,\\) and \\(e\\) along the diagonal.
