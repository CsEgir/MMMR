    "output": "To solve this problem, we need to calculate the probability that no two coins lie in the same row or column when three coins are randomly placed in different squares of a \\(4 \\times 4\\) grid.\n\nFirst, let's determine the total number of ways to place three coins in different squares of the grid.

Graph 1 has all vertices with degree 3, while Graph 3 has a mix of degrees (3 and 2). Therefore, Graph 1 and Graph 3 are not isomorphic.\n\n- Graph 2 has a different number of edges (16) and a different degree distribution (all vertices have degree 4) compared to Graph 1 and Graph 3. Therefore, Graph 2 is not isomorphic to either Graph 1 or Graph 3.\n\nThus, Graph 1 and Graph 3 are not isomorphic, and Graph 2 is not isomorphic to either of them.\n\nThe graphs that are not isomorphic are Graph 1 and Graph 3.\n\n\\[\\boxed{1, 3}\\]",

The square \\(PNCD\\) is perpendicular to \\(ABCD\\).\n\nLet's place the square \\(ABCD\\) in the \\(xy\\)-plane with \\(A = (0, 0, 0)\\), \\(B = (2, 0, 0)\\), \\(C = (2, 2, 0)\\), and \\(D = (0, 2, 0)\\).\n\nThe square \\(PNCD\\) is perpendicular to \\(ABCD\\), so we can place it in the \\(yz\\)-plane with \\(P = (0, 0, 2)\\), \\(N = (0, 2, 2)\\), \\(C = (2, 2, 0)\\), and \\(D = (0, 2, 0)\\).\n\nThe triangle \\(PMN\\) is parallel to \\(ABCD\\) and has \\(\\angle PMN = 90^\\circ\\) with \\(PM = MN\\). Since \\(PMN\\) is parallel to \\(ABCD\\), the coordinates of \\(M\\) can be determined by maintaining the perpendicularity and equal length condition.\n\nSince \\(PM = MN\\) and \\(\\angle PMN = 90^\\circ\\), \\(M\\) must be at the midpoint of the line segment joining \\(P\\) and \\(N\\) in the \\(xz\\)-plane.

If Herc reaches a maximum height of $100 \\mathrm{~m}$, directly above a point $30 \\mathrm{~m}$ from the cannon, determine the horizontal distance from the cannon to the net.",

The parabola can be described by the equation:\n\n\\[ y = ax^2 + bx + c \\]\n\nSince the cannon is at ground level, we have the point \\((0, 0)\\), which gives us \\(c = 0\\). Thus, the equation simplifies to:\n\n\\[ y = ax^2 + bx \\]\n\nWe know that the maximum height of 100 m occurs at \\(x = 30\\) m. Therefore, the vertex of the parabola is at \\((30, 100)\\). The vertex form of a parabola is:\n\n\\[ y = a(x - h)^2 + k \\]\n\nwhere \\((h, k)\\) is the vertex. Substituting the vertex \\((30, 100)\\), we have:\n\n\\[ y = a(x - 30)^2 + 100 \\]\n\nWe also know that when \\(x = 0\\), \\(y = 0\\). Substituting these values into the vertex form equation gives:\n\n\\[ 0 = a(0 - 30)^2 + 100 \\]\n\n\\[ 0 = 900a + 100 \\]\n\nSolving for \\(a\\), we get:\n\n\\[ 900a = -100 \\]\n\n\\[ a = -\\frac{100}{900} = -\\frac{1}{9} \\]\n\nThus, the equation of the parabola is:\n\n\\[ y = -\\frac{1}{9}(x - 30)^2 + 100 \\]\n\nNow, we need to find the horizontal distance from the cannon to the net, which is at point \\(B\\) where \\(y = 64\\) m.

For example, a triangle with vertices at points \\(A, B, C\\) can be described by the number of points between \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), \\(B\\) and \\(C\\), and \\(C\\) and \\(A\\).\n\nTo count distinct triangles, we consider the possible side length combinations. Since there are 15 points, the possible side lengths (in terms of number of points between vertices) must sum to 15. For example, a triangle with side lengths 3, 5, and 7 is congruent to a triangle with side lengths 7, 3, and 5 due to rotation.\n\nThe distinct triangles can be categorized by the different combinations of side lengths that sum to 15, considering rotations and reflections. After analyzing the possible combinations, we find that there are 7 distinct triangles:\n\n1. Equilateral triangle (5, 5, 5)\n2. Isosceles triangles (4, 4, 7), (3, 3, 9)\n3. Scalene triangles (3, 4, 8), (3, 5, 7), (4, 5, 6)\n\nThus, the number of distinct triangles that can be formed is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{7}\n\\]",

This means that for each point on the circle $S^1$, the entire vertical segment from the top to the bottom of the cylinder is collapsed to a single point.\n\nThis identification effectively collapses the interval $I$ to a single point for each point on $S^1$. Therefore, the quotient space is homeomorphic to $S^1$, as each vertical line segment becomes a single point, and the entire cylinder collapses to a circle.\n\nNow, let's consider the options given:\n\n- (A) $S^2$: The 2-sphere is not homeomorphic to the quotient space, as the quotient space is one-dimensional.\n- (B) $T^2$: The 2-torus is a two-dimensional surface, which is not homeomorphic to the one-dimensional quotient space.\n- (C) $\\mathbb{R}P^2$: The real projective plane is a two-dimensional surface, which is not homeomorphic to the one-dimensional quotient space.\n- (D) $S^1 \\times S^1$: The product of two circles is a two-dimensional surface, which is not homeomorphic to the one-dimensional quotient space.\n\nNone of the options directly match the one-dimensional quotient space we derived. However, upon further consideration, the identification described is similar to collapsing the cylinder to a single circle, which is not explicitly listed as an option. Therefore, the problem might have an implicit assumption or error in the options provided.\n\nGiven the options, none of them are directly homeomorphic to the quotient space derived. However, if we consider the possibility of a misinterpretation or implicit assumption, the closest match in terms of dimensionality and identification is option (D) $S^1 \\times S^1$, as it involves circles, although it is not strictly correct.\n\nThus, based on the options provided and the reasoning above, the answer is not explicitly listed. However, if forced to choose from the given options, the closest match in terms of the identification process described would be option (D), although it is not strictly correct.\n\n\\boxed{D}",

Therefore, the expected number of visits to the central cell, \\( E_n \\), will tend to infinity as \\( n \\to \\infty \\).\n\nThus, the correct statement regarding the behavior of \\( E_n \\) as \\( n \\to \\infty \\) is:\n\n\\(\\lim_{n\\to\\infty} E_n = \\infty\\)\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is option (A).\n\n\\[\\boxed{A}\\]",

We have:\n\\[\nBC^2 + FC^2 = 24^2 = 576\n\\]\n\nNow, consider the entire rectangle \\(ABCD\\):\n\\[\nAB^2 + AD^2 = BD^2 = 20^2 = 400\n\\]\n\nWe have three equations:\n1. \\(AD^2 + ED^2 = 225\\)\n2. \\(BC^2 + FC^2 = 576\\)\n3. \\(AB^2 + AD^2 = 400\\)\n\nSince \\(AB = BC\\) and \\(AD = DC\\) in a rectangle, we can solve for \\(AB\\) and \\(AD\\).\n\nFrom equation 3:\n\\[\nAB^2 + AD^2 = 400\n\\]\n\nUsing the fact that \\(ED\\) and \\(FC\\) are perpendicular to the sides:\n- \\(ED = AB\\)\n- \\(FC = AD\\)\n\nSubstitute \\(ED = AB\\) into equation 1:\n\\[\nAD^2 + AB^2 = 225\n\\]\n\nSubstitute \\(FC = AD\\) into equation 2:\n\\[\nAB^2 + AD^2 = 576\n\\]\n\nNow solve the system of equations:\n1. \\(AD^2 + AB^2 = 225\\)\n2. \\(AB^2 + AD^2 = 400\\)\n\nSubtract equation 1 from equation 3:\n\\[\n(AB^2 + AD^2) - (AD^2 + AB^2) = 400 - 225\n\\]\n\\[\n0 = 175\n\\]\n\nThis indicates an error in the setup. Let's reconsider the approach.\n\nInstead, use the fact that \\(AB^2 + AD^2 = 400\\) and solve directly for \\(AB\\) and \\(AD\\).\n\nSince \\(AB^2 + AD^2 = 400\\), and knowing \\(AE = 15\\) and \\(BF = 24\\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem directly:\n\n\\[\nAB = \\sqrt{400 - AD^2}\n\\]\n\nGiven the setup, let's solve for \\(AB\\) and \\(AD\\) using the correct approach:\n\nSince \\(AB^2 + AD^2 = 400\\), and knowing \\(AE = 15\\) and \\(BF = 24\\), we can use the Pythagorean theorem directly:\n\n\\[\nAB = \\sqrt{400 -
