We know that ∠RMN and ∠MNR are consecutive angles.  Therefore:\n\nm∠RMN + m∠MNR = 180°\n\n**2. Substitute the known value:**\n\nWe are given that m∠MNR = 33°.

There must be a mistake in the problem statement or the diagram.  Let's re-examine the information given.  The diagram shows that ∠RMN and ∠RPN are opposite angles, and opposite angles in a parallelogram are equal.  We are given that ∠R = 38°.  Since consecutive angles are supplementary, we have:\n\nm∠RMN + m∠R = 180°\nm∠RMN + 38° = 180°\nm∠RMN = 180° - 38° = 142°\n\nThis is still not among the choices.  There's an inconsistency in the provided information.  The only way to get one of the given answers is to assume that 33° is the measure of ∠RMN.  However, this contradicts the parallelogram properties.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThere's an error in the problem statement or diagram.  None of the provided choices are correct based on the properties of parallelograms.

Then $A = 10000 - 2A$, so $3A = 10000$, and $A = \\frac{10000}{3}$.\nHowever, this is incorrect.\nLet's use the fact that $\\triangle FBD \\cong \\triangle AEC$.\nThe area of the shaded region is half the area of the rectangle.\nArea of shaded region = $\\frac{1}{2} \\times 200 \\times 50 = 5000$.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{5000}$",

Essentially, you can redraw one graph to make it look exactly like the other.\n\n**Analyzing the Graphs**\n\n* **Graph 1 and Graph 2:** These graphs appear different at first glance. However, a careful examination reveals that they are isomorphic.  You can redraw Graph 1 to match Graph 2 by adjusting the positions of the vertices.  They have the same degree sequence (the number of edges connected to each vertex).\n\n* **Graph 3:** This graph is *not* isomorphic to Graph 1 or Graph 2.  While it has the same number of vertices and edges, the connections are different.  Notice the central square in Graph 3.  There is no equivalent structure in Graph 1 or Graph 2.

Surface Area of the Quarter-Sphere:**\n\n* The radius of the quarter-sphere is 7.1 cm (given).\n* The surface area of a sphere is 4πr².  A quarter-sphere has a surface area of (1/4) * 4πr² + πr² (the circular base).\n* Surface area of the quarter-sphere = π(7.1 cm)² + π(7.1 cm)² = 2π(7.1 cm)² ≈ 316.7 cm²\n\n**3.  Area of the Cut-out:**\n\n* The quarter-sphere's curved surface area is removed from the cube's surface area.  The circular base of the quarter-sphere is also removed.

We can use the cosine rule to find the angle 'b':\n\n16² = 12² + x² - 2 * 12 * x * cos(49°)\n\nSolving this equation for x (the distance from the current point to the starting point) is complex and not necessary for finding the bearing.  Instead, we can use the sine rule:\n\nsin(b) / 16 = sin(49°) / x\n\nWe don't need to solve for x; we can use the sine rule to find angle b directly.  Let's use the fact that the angles in a triangle add up to 180°:\n\nb + 49° + angle opposite 16 km = 180°\n\nTo find the angle opposite 16 km, we can use the sine rule:\n\nsin(angle opposite 16 km) / 12 = sin(49°) / 16\n\nsin(angle opposite 16 km) = (12/16) * sin(49°) \nangle opposite 16 km = arcsin((12/16) * sin(49°)) ≈ 34.2°\n\nNow we can find b:\n\nb = 180° - 49° - 34.2° ≈ 96.8°\n\n**2. Find the bearing:**\n\nThe bearing is measured clockwise from North.  The boat needs to travel in the direction opposite to the vector from the start to the current point.  The angle 'a' is the angle we need to find.\n\nThe angle 'a' is supplementary to angle 'b':\n\na = 180° - b ≈ 180° - 96.8° ≈ 83.2°\n\nTherefore, the bearing is approximately 83.2° + 180° = 263.2° (measured clockwise from North).  However, this is not the correct approach.\n\nLet's use the sine rule to find the angle opposite the 12km side:\n\nsin(θ)/16 = sin(49°)/12\n\nθ = arcsin(16sin(49°)/12) ≈ 72.8°\n\nThe angle from North to the starting point is 180° - 72.8° = 107.2°\n\nThe bearing to return to the starting point is 107.2° + 180° = 287.2°\n\nTherefore, the bearing is approximately 287°.\n\n$\\boxed{answer = 287}$",

    "output": "Let the vertices of the cube be denoted by A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H. The midpoints of the edges are denoted by M1, M2, ..., M12. The polygon formed by connecting these midpoints is a hexagon.\n\nThe sum of the interior angles of a polygon with n sides is given by the formula (n-2) * 180 degrees.\nIn this case, the polygon has 6 sides (it's a hexagon), so the sum of its interior angles is (6-2) * 180 = 4 * 180 = 720 degrees.\n\nHowever, the polygon shown in the image is not a simple hexagon. It is a skew hexagon, meaning that its vertices do not all lie in the same plane.  The formula (n-2) * 180 degrees only applies to polygons in a plane.\n\nTo find the sum of the interior angles of this skew hexagon, we can use the fact that the sum of the exterior angles of any polygon is always 360 degrees.  However, this doesn't directly help us find the sum of the interior angles.\n\nLet's consider the faces of the cube.  Each face is a square. The polygon intersects each face.  The intersection of the polygon with each face forms a quadrilateral.  The sum of the interior angles of each quadrilateral is 360 degrees.  Since there are 6 faces, the total sum of the interior angles of the quadrilaterals formed by the intersection of the polygon with the faces of the cube is 6 * 360 = 2160 degrees.  However, this is not the sum of the interior angles of the hexagon.\n\nThe polygon formed by connecting the midpoints of the edges of a cube is a hexagon.  The sum of the interior angles of a hexagon is (6-2) * 180 = 720 degrees.  This is true regardless of whether the hexagon is planar or not.  The sum of the interior angles of a skew polygon is not necessarily (n-2) * 180 degrees.  However, in this case, the sum of the interior angles is still 720 degrees.\n\nFinal Answer: The final answer is $\\boxed{720}$",
