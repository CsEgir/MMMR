This means that for every point (x, y) on one curve, there is also a corresponding point (-x, -y) on the other curve.\n\nLet's consider a vertical line passing through the x-axis at some value of x. For example, let's take x = 1. The vertical line would intersect the graph at two points: one where it intersects the upper curve and another where it intersects the lower curve.\n\nSince the graph is symmetrical about the x-axis, these two points will have the same x-coordinate but different y-coordinates.

Since \u2220ABC is given as 60 degrees, we can use the fact that the sum of angles in a triangle is 180 degrees. However, we don't have enough information about the other two angles in triangle ABC to directly determine \u2220CDE.\n\nInstead, let's look at the cyclic quadrilateral ABDC. In a cyclic quadrilateral, the opposite angles are supplementary (they add up to 180 degrees). So, \u2220ADC + \u2220ABC = 180 degrees. Therefore, \u2220ADC = 180 - 60 = 120 degrees.\n\nNow, since \u2220ADC is an exterior angle to triangle CDE, it is equal to the sum of the two non-adjacent interior angles of triangle CDE. That means \u2220ADC = \u2220CDE + \u2220DCE. But since \u2220ADC = 120 degrees and \u2220DCE is the same as \u2220ABC (because they are vertically opposite angles), \u2220DCE = 60 degrees.

For any given topping, there are two possible semicircular halves it can be placed in.

This means no single semicircular half contains more than one topping. Since there are only two semicircular halves and $N$ toppings, this situation is impossible because there are not enough semicircular halves to accommodate all $N$ toppings without overlap.\n\nThus, at least one semicircular half must contain at least two toppings. This ensures that there is at least one region of the pizza with non-zero area that is covered by all $N$ toppings.\n\nTherefore, the probability that some region of the pizza with non-zero area is covered by all $N$ toppings is $1$, since it is guaranteed that at least one region will be covered by all toppings due to the constraints of the problem.\n\nThe final answer is \\boxed{1}.",

Let's denote these sequences as \\(A_1, A_2, A_3\\) for the increasing sequences and \\(B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4\\) for the decreasing sequences.\n\n### Step-by-Step Solution:\n\n1. **Identify the positions of the increasing and decreasing sequences:**\n   - The increasing sequences \\(A_1, A_2, A_3\\) must be placed such that they do not overlap with each other or with the decreasing sequences.\n   - The decreasing sequences \\(B_1, B_2, B_3, B_4\\) must also be placed such that they do not overlap with each other or with the increasing sequences.\n\n2. **Determine the possible placements:**\n   - We start with the smallest number (1) and place it in one of the increasing sequences. This gives us 3 choices for the first position.\n   - After placing the first number in an increasing sequence, we move to the next smallest number (2). It can either be part of an increasing sequence or a decreasing sequence. If it is part of an increasing sequence, we have 2 choices; if it is part of a decreasing sequence, we have 4 choices.\n   - We continue this process until all numbers are placed.\n\n3. **Calculate the total number of permutations:**\n   - For each choice of placement, we need to ensure that the remaining numbers fit into the remaining slots without violating the signature.\n   - The exact calculation involves combinatorial methods and ensuring that the signature is maintained throughout the permutation.\n\nGiven the complexity of the problem, we can use known results from combinatorics related to Dyck paths and Catalan numbers. The number of ways to arrange \\(n\\) pairs of parentheses (or in this case, \\(n\\) pairs of increasing and decreasing sequences) is given by the \\(n\\)-th Catalan number \\(C_n\\).\n\nFor \\(n = 7\\) (since we have 7 pairs of increasing and decreasing sequences):\n\\[ C_7 = \\frac{1}{8} \\binom{14}{7} = \\frac{1}{8} \\times \\frac{14!}{7!7!} = \\frac{1}{8} \\times 3432 = 429 \\]\n\nThus, the number of 9-labels with the given 2-signature is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{429}\n\\]",

            "question": "The arrangement of numbers known as Pascal's Triangle has fascinated mathematicians for centuries. In fact, about 700 years before Pascal, the Indian mathematician Halayudha wrote about it in his commentaries to a then-1000-year-old treatise on verse structure by the Indian poet and mathematician Pingala, who called it the Meruprast\u0101ra, or \"Mountain of Gems\". In this Power Question, we'll explore some properties of Pingala's/Pascal's Triangle (\"PT\") and its variants.\n\nUnless otherwise specified, the only definition, notation, and formulas you may use for PT are the definition, notation, and formulas given below.\n\nPT consists of an infinite number of rows, numbered from 0 onwards. The $n^{\\text {th }}$ row contains $n+1$ numbers, identified as $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)$, where $0 \\leq k \\leq n$. For all $n$, define $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, 0)=\\operatorname{Pa}(n, n)=1$. Then for $n>1$ and $1 \\leq k \\leq n-1$, define $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)=\\mathrm{Pa}(n-1, k-1)+\\mathrm{Pa}(n-1, k)$. It is convenient to define $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)=0$ when $k<0$ or $k>n$. We write the nonzero values of $\\mathrm{PT}$ in the familiar pyramid shown below.\n\n<image>\n\nAs is well known, $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)$ gives the number of ways of choosing a committee of $k$ people from a set of $n$ people, so a simple formula for $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)$ is $\\mathrm{Pa}(n, k)=\\frac{n !}{k !(n-k) !}$. You may use this formula or the recursive definition above throughout this Power Question.\n\nClark's Triangle: If the left side of PT is replaced with consecutive multiples of 6 , starting with 0 , but the right entries (except the first) and the generating rule are left unchanged, the result is called Clark's Triangle. If the $k^{\\text {th }}$ entry of the $n^{\\text {th }}$ row is denoted by $\\mathrm{Cl}(n, k)$, then the formal rule is:\n\n$$\n\\begin{cases}\\mathrm{Cl}(n, 0)=6 n & \\text { for all } n \\\\ \\mathrm{Cl}(n, n)=1 & \\text { for } n \\geq 1 \\\\ \\mathrm{Cl}(n, k)=\\mathrm{Cl}(n-1, k-1)+\\mathrm{Cl}(n-1, k) & \\text { for } n \\geq 1 \\text { and } 1 \\leq k \\leq n-1\\end{cases}\n$$\n\nThe first four rows of Clark's Triangle are given below.\n\n<image>\nCompute $\\mathrm{Cl}(11,2)$.\nA. nan\nB. nan\nC. nan\nD. nan\nE. nan\nF. nan\nG. nan\nH. nan\nI. nan\nJ. nan\nK. nan\nL. nan\n\nPlease provide the final answer and store it in \\boxed{answer}.",

However, recognizing that each entry in Clark's Triangle is derived from the sum of two entries above it in the previous row, we can see that the value of $\\mathrm{Cl}(11, 2)$ will be significantly larger than the initial values due to the exponential growth pattern.\n\nGiven the complexity and the fact that the problem asks for a specific answer (which seems to imply a numerical result), it's likely that the intended solution involves a simplification or a known property of Clark's Triangle that allows us to directly compute the desired value without extensive calculation.\n\nHowever, based on the provided options and the nature of the question, it appears there might be an error in the setup or interpretation of the problem. The correct approach should involve either a direct computation or leveraging properties of Pascal's Triangle or Clark's Triangle that are not explicitly stated but could be inferred from the context.\n\nSince the problem does not provide enough information to determine the exact value of $\\mathrm{Cl}(11, 2)$ without additional context or simplifying assumptions, and considering the options provided, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or missing information in the problem statement.\n\nTherefore, the most appropriate response, acknowledging the limitations of the given information, is to indicate that the problem cannot be solved with the provided data and options.

            "output": "To find the number of $(2n+1)$-labels with the 2-signature $(\\underbrace{12,12, \\ldots, 12}_{n}, \\underbrace{21,21, \\ldots, 21}_{n})$, we need to understand how these labels are constructed based on the given signature.\n\nThe signature indicates that there are $n$ blocks of numbers increasing by 1 (denoted as \"12\") and $n$ blocks of numbers decreasing by 1 (denoted as \"21\"). This means that in a valid $(2n+1)$-label, we have exactly $n$ up steps and $n$ down steps, which must be arranged such that they form a single continuous path from 1 to $2n+1$ without any intermediate numbers being repeated.\n\nThis problem can be translated into finding the number of ways to arrange $n$ up steps and $n$ down steps in a sequence. This is equivalent to finding the number of distinct permutations of a sequence of length $2n+1$ where each element is either an \"up\" step or a \"down\" step.\n\nThe number of such permutations is given by the binomial coefficient $\\binom{2n+1}{n}$, which represents the number of ways to choose $n$ positions out of $2n+1$ for the \"up\" steps (or equivalently, for the \"down\" steps).\n\nTherefore, the number of $(2n+1)$-labels with the given 2-signature is:\n\n$$\n\\binom{2n+1}{n}\n$$\n\nSo, the final answer is:\n\n\\boxed{\\binom{2n+1}{n}}",

This implies the radius of the sphere is actually 4 cm, but the problem might have a different interpretation where the ball is not just touching the water but also partially submerged.\n\nGiven the options, let's consider the possibility that the ball is fully submerged in the water up to a certain point, and the volume calculation should reflect this correctly.\n\nThe correct answer based on the given options and the problem's context would be:\n\n\\boxed{\\frac{866 \\pi}{3} \\mathrm{~cm}^3}",

A top view showing a square with a diagonal line.\n2. A front view showing a square with a diagonal line.\n3. A side view showing a square with a diagonal line.\n\nThese views suggest that the cut is made along the space diagonals of the cube, dividing it into two equal parts. This means that the cut passes through the center of the cube and divides it into two congruent pyramids.\n\nSince the cut is along the space diagonals, each pyramid formed by the cut has half the volume of the original cube. Therefore, the volume of each pyramid is $\\frac{1}{8}$ of the volume of the original cube (since the cube is divided into 8 smaller identical pyramids).\n\nThus, the volume of the remaining part of the cube is $7 \\times \\frac{1}{8} = \\frac{7}{8}$ of the original cube's volume.\n\nThe volume of the cut-off part is $1 - \\frac{7}{8} = \\frac{1}{8}$ of the original cube's volume.\n\nTherefore, the ratio of the volume of the cut-off part to the volume of the remaining part is $\\frac{\\frac{1}{8}}{\\frac{7}{8}} = \\frac{1}{7}$.\n\nSo, the correct answer is B. $\\boxed{\\frac{1}{7}}$.",

            "output": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the relationship between the areas of the black and white parts in the\u592a\u6781\u56fe (Taoist symbol) within the square.\n\n1. **Area of the Square**: Let's denote the side length of the square as $s$. The area of the square is then $s^2$.\n\n2. **Area of the Circle**: Since the circle is inscribed in the square, its diameter is equal to the side length of the square, which means the radius of the circle is $\\frac{s}{2}$. The area of the circle is given by $\\pi \\left(\\frac{s}{2}\\right)^2 = \\frac{\\pi s^2}{4}$.\n\n3. **Area of the Black Part**: The black part consists of two quarter-circles, each with an area of $\\frac{1}{4} \\cdot \\frac{\\pi s^2}{4} = \\frac{\\pi s^2}{16}$.

            "output": "To solve this problem, we need to understand the logic of the given program and calculate the value of $S$ for different values of $N$ until we find the smallest $N$ that makes $S < 91$.\n\nThe program starts with $t = 1$, $M = 100$, and $S = 0$. It then enters a loop where it checks if $t \\leq N$. If true, it adds $M$ to $S$, updates $M$ to $-\\frac{M}{10}$, and increments $t$ by 1. The loop continues until $t > N$, at which point it outputs $S$.\n\nLet's calculate $S$ for each option:\n\n- **Option A: $N = 5$**\n  - $t = 1$: $S = 0 + 100 = 100$\n  - $t = 2$: $S = 100 - \\frac{100}{10} = 90$\n  - $t = 3$: $S = 90 - \\frac{90}{10} = 81$\n  - $t = 4$: $S = 81 - \\frac{81}{10} = 72.9$\n  - $t = 5$: $S = 72.9 - \\frac{72.9}{10} = 65.61$\n\n  Since $S < 91$ when $N = 5$, this is a valid solution.\n\n- **Option B: $N = 4$**\n  - $t = 1$: $S = 0 + 100 = 100$\n  - $t = 2$: $S = 100 - \\frac{100}{10} = 90$\n  - $t = 3$: $S = 90 - \\frac{90}{10} = 81$\n  - $t = 4$: $S = 81 - \\frac{81}{10} = 72.9$\n\n  Since $S < 91$ when $N = 4$, this is also a valid solution.\n\n- **Option C: $N = 3$**\n  - $t = 1$: $S = 0 + 100 = 100$\n  - $t = 2$: $S = 100 - \\frac{100}{10} = 90$\n  - $t = 3$: $S = 90 - \\frac{90}{10} = 81$\n\n  Since $S < 91$ when $N = 3$, this is also a valid solution.\n\n- **Option D: $N = 2$**\n  - $t = 1$: $S = 0 + 100 = 100$\n  - $t = 2$: $S = 100 - \\frac{100}{10} = 90$\n\n  Since $S < 91$ when $N = 2$, this is also a valid solution.\n\nHowever, since the question asks for the smallest value of $N$ that satisfies the condition, we should choose the smallest possible value among the options provided. Therefore, the correct answer is:\n\n\\boxed{D}",
