            "output": "The correct answer is (D) It is impossible to start a fire using this method. \n\nThe key point here is that the magnifying glass is being used to focus sunlight onto the wood, creating a concentrated heat source. The distance at which the wood starts to smoke indicates that the heat is too intense and concentrated, causing the wood to ignite. To start a fire, the heat needs to be spread out more evenly, which is not possible with a magnifying glass. Therefore, it is impossible to start a fire using this method with the given distance of 15 inches.",

Adding these percentages gives us 37%, not 40%.

Adding these numbers (1,100 + 1,050 + 950 + 990 + 1,200) gives us 5,390 shares, not 4,870.

B\nC. C\nD. D\nE. E\nF. F\n\nWe need to find the shape that fits the pattern of repeating T three times. \n\n- Option A: Does not repeat T three times.\n- Option B: Does not repeat T three times.\n- Option C: Does not repeat T three times.\n- Option D: Does not repeat T three times.\n- Option E: Does not repeat T three times.\n- Option F: Does not repeat T three times.\n\nNone of the options provided seem to fit the pattern of repeating T three times. This suggests that there might be an error in the options or the question itself. However, based on the given options, none of them match the pattern.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is \\boxed{None of the provided options fit the pattern.}",
